<h1>THE EVE OF
THE REFORMATION</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<p>The English Reformation presents a variety of problems
to the student of history. Amongst them not the least
difficult or important is the general question, How are
we to account for the sudden beginning and the ultimate
success of a movement which, apparently at least, was
opposed to the religious convictions and feelings of the
nation at large? To explain away the difficulty, we are
asked by some writers to believe that the religious revolution,
although perhaps unrecognised at the moment
when the storm first burst, had long been inevitable,
and indeed that its issue had been foreseen by the
most learned and capable men in England. To some,
it appears that the Church, on the eve of the Reformation,
had long lost its hold on the intelligence and
affection of the English people. Discontented with
the powers claimed by the ecclesiastical authority, and
secretly disaffected to much of the mediæval teaching
of religious truth and to many of the traditional religious
ordinances, the laity were, it is suggested, only
too eager to seize upon the first opportunity of emancipating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
themselves from a thraldom which in practice had
become intolerable. An increase of knowledge, too, it
is supposed, had inevitably led men to view as false and
superstitious many of the practices of religion which
had been acquiesced in and followed without doubt or
question in earlier and more simple days. Men, with the
increasing light, had come to see, in the support given
to these practices by the clergy, a determination to keep
people at large in ignorance, and to make capital out of
many of these objectionable features of mediæval worship.</p>

<p>Moreover, such writers assume that in reality there
was little or no practical religion among the mass of
the people for some considerable time before the outbreak
of the religious difficulties in the sixteenth century.
According to their reading of the facts, the nation, as
such, had long lost its interest in the religion of its
forefathers. Receiving no instruction in faith and
morals worthy of the name, they had been allowed by
the neglect of the clergy to grow up in ignorance of the
teachings, and in complete neglect of the duties, of their
religion. Ecclesiastics generally, secular as well as religious,
had, it is suggested, forfeited the respect and
esteem of the laity by their evil and mercenary lives;
whilst, imagining that the surest way to preserve the
remnants of their former power was to keep the people
ignorant, they had opposed the literary revival of the
fifteenth century by every means at their command.
In a word, the picture of the pre-Reformation Church
ordinarily drawn for us is that of a system honeycombed
with disaffection and unbelief, the natural and
necessary outcome of an attempt to maintain at all
hazards an effete ecclesiastical organisation, which clung
with the tenacity of despair to doctrines and observances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which the world at large had ceased to accept as true,
or to observe as any part of its reasonable service.</p>

<p>In view of these and similar assertions, it is of
interest and importance to ascertain, if possible, what
really was the position of the Church in the eyes of the
nation at large on the eve of the Reformation, to understand
the attitude of men’s minds to the system as they
knew it, and to discover, as far as may be, what in
regard to religion they were doing and saying and thinking
about, when the change came upon them. It is
precisely this information which it has hitherto been
difficult to get, and the present work is designed to
supply some evidence on these matters. It does not
pretend in any sense to be a history of the English
Reformation, to give any consecutive narrative of the
religious movements in this country during the sixteenth
century, or to furnish an adequate account of the causes
which led up to them. The volume in reality presents
to the reader merely a series of separate studies which,
whilst joined together by a certain connecting thread,
must not be taken as claiming to present any complete
picture of the period immediately preceding the Reformation,
still less of that movement itself.</p>

<p>This is intentional. Those who know most about
this portion of our national history will best understand
how impossible it is as yet for any one, however well
informed, to write the history of the Reformation itself
or to draw for us any detailed and accurate picture of
the age that went before that great event, and is supposed
by some to have led up to it. The student of this
great social and religious movement must at present be
content to address himself to the necessary work of sifting
and examining the many new sources of information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
which the researches of late years have opened out
to the inquirer. For example, what a vast field of
work is not supplied by the <i>Calendar of Papers, Foreign
and Domestic, of the Reign of Henry VIII.</i> alone! In
many ways this monumental work may well be considered
one of the greatest literary achievements of the
age. It furnishes the student of this portion of our
national history with a vast catalogue of material, all of
which must be examined, weighed, and arranged, before
it is possible to pass a judgment upon the great religious
revolution of the sixteenth century. And, though obviously
affording grounds for a reconsideration of many
of the conclusions previously formed in regard to this
perplexing period, it must in no sense be regarded as
even an exhaustive calendar of the available material.
Rolls, records, and documents of all kinds exist in
public and private archives, which are not included in
these State Papers, but which are equally necessary for
the formation of a sound and reliable opinion on the
whole story. Besides this vast mass of material, the
entire literature of the period demands careful examination,
as it must clearly throw great light on the tone
and temper of men’s minds, and reveal the origin and
growth of popular views and opinions.</p>

<p>Writers, such as Burnet, for example, and others,
have indeed presented their readers with the story of
the Reformation as a whole, and have not hesitated to
set out at length, and with assurance, the causes which
led up to that event. Whether true or false, they have
made their synthesis, and taking a comprehensive view
of the entire subject, they have rendered their story
more plausible by the unity of idea it was designed to
illustrate and confirm. The real value of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
synthesis, however, must of course entirely depend on
the data upon which it rests. The opening up of new
sources of information and the examination of old
sources in the critical spirit now demanded in all historical
investigations have fully proved, however, not
merely this or that fact to be wrong, but that whole
lines of argument are without justification, and general
deductions without reasonable basis. In other words,
the old synthesis has been founded upon false facts and
false inferences.</p>

<p>Whilst, however, seeing that the old story of the
Reformation in England is wrong on some of the main
lines upon which it depended, it is for reasons just stated
impossible at present to substitute a new synthesis for
the old. However unsatisfactory it may appear to be
reduced to the analysis of sources and the examination
of details, nothing more can safely be attempted at the
present time. A general view cannot be taken until
the items that compose it have been proved and tested
and found correct. Till such time a provisional appreciation
at best of the general subject is alone possible. The
present volume then is occupied solely with some details,
and I have endeavoured mainly by an examination of
the literature of the period in question to gather some
evidence of the mental attitude of the English people
towards the religious system which prevailed before the
rejection of the Roman jurisdiction by Henry VIII.</p>

<p>In regard to the general question, one or two observations
may be premised.</p>

<p>At the outset it may be allowed that in many things
there was need of reform in its truest sense. This
was recognised by the best and most staunch sons of
Holy Church; and the Council of Trent itself, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
we read its decrees and measure its language, is sufficient
proof that by the highest authorities it was
acknowledged that every effort must be made to purify
the Church from abuses, superstitions, and scandals
which, in the course of the long ages of its existence,
had sprung from its contact with the world and through
the human weaknesses of its rulers and ministers. In
reality, however, the movement for reform did not in
any way begin with Trent, nor was it the mere outcome
of a terror inspired by the wholesale defection of
nations under the influence of the Lutheran Reformation.
The need had long been acknowledged by the
best and most devoted sons of the Church. There
were those, whom M. Eugène Müntz has designated
the “morose cardinals,” who saw whither things were
tending, and strove to the utmost of their power to
avert the impending catastrophe. As Janssen has
pointed out, in the middle of the fifteenth century, for
instance, Nicholas of Cusa initiated reforms in Germany,
with the approval&mdash;if not by the positive
injunctions&mdash;of the Pope. It was, however, a true
reform, a reform founded on the principle “not of
destruction, but of purification and renewal.” Holding
that “it was not for men to change what was holy;
but for the holy to change man,” he began by reforming
himself and preaching by example. He restored
discipline and eagerly welcomed the revival of learning
and the invention of printing as the most powerful
auxiliaries of true religion. His projects of general
ecclesiastical reforms presented to Pius II. are admirable.
Without wishing to touch the organisation of the
Church, he desired full and drastic measures of “reformation
in head and members.” But all this was entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
different from the spirit and aim of those who attacked the
Church under the leadership of Luther and his followers.
Their object was not the reform and purification of abuses,
but the destruction and overthrow of the existing religious
system. Before, say, 1517 or even 1521, no one
at this period ever dreamt of wishing to change the basis
of the Christian religion, as it was then understood. The
most earnest and zealous sons of the Church never hesitated
to attack this or that abuse, and to point out this
or that spot, desiring to make the edifice of God’s Church,
as they understood it, more solid, more useful, and more
like Christ’s ideal. They never dreamt that their work
could undermine the edifice, much less were their aims
directed to pulling down the walls and digging up the
foundations; such a possibility was altogether foreign
to their conception of the essential constitution of
Christ’s Church. To suggest that men like Colet, More,
and Erasmus had any leaning to, or sympathy with,
“the Reformation” as we know it, is, in view of what
they have written, absolutely false and misleading.</p>

<p>The fact is, that round the true history of the
Reformation movement in England, there has grown
up, as Janssen has shown had been the case in Germany,
a mass of legend from which it is often difficult
enough to disentangle the truth. It has been suggested,
for instance, that the period which preceded the advent
of the new religious ideas was, to say the least, a period
of stagnation. That, together with the light of what is
called the Gospel, came the era of national prosperity,
and that the golden age of literature and art was the
outcome of that liberty and freedom of spirit which was
the distinct product of the Protestant Reformation.
And yet what are the facts? Was the age immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
before the religious upheaval of the sixteenth century
so very black, and was it the magic genius of Luther
who divined how to call forth the light out of the
“void and empty darkness”? Luther, himself, shall
tell us his opinion of the century before the rise of
Protestantism. “Any one reading the chronicles,” he
writes, “will find that since the birth of Christ there is
nothing that can compare with what has happened in
our world during the last hundred years. Never in any
country have people seen so much building, so much
cultivation of the soil. Never has such good drink,
such abundant and delicate food, been within the reach
of so many. Dress has become so rich that it cannot
in this respect be improved. Who has ever heard of
commerce such as we see it to-day? It circles the
globe; it embraces the whole world! Painting, engraving&mdash;all
the arts&mdash;have progressed and are still improving.
More than all, we have men so capable, and so
learned, that their wit penetrates everything in such a
way, that nowadays a youth of twenty knows more
than twenty doctors did in days gone by.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In this passage we have the testimony of the German
reformer himself that the eve of the Reformation
was in no sense a period of stagnation. The world was
fully awake, and the light of learning and art had already
dawned upon the earth. The progress of commerce and
the prosperity of peoples owed nothing to the religious
revolt of the sixteenth century. Nor is this true only
for Germany. There is evidence to prove that Luther’s
picture is as correct in that period for England. Learning,
there can be no question, in the fifteenth century,
found a congenial soil in this country. In its origin, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
well as in its progress, the English revival of letters,
which may be accurately gauged by the renewal of
Greek studies, found its chief patrons in the fifteenth
and early sixteenth centuries among the clergy and the
most loyal lay sons of the Church. The fears of Erasmus
that the rise of Lutheranism would prove the death-blow
of solid scholarship were literally fulfilled. In
England, no less than in Germany, amid the religious
difficulties and the consequent social disturbances, learning,
except in so far as it served to aid the exigencies of
polemics or meet the controversial needs of the hour,
declined for well-nigh a century; and so far from the
Reformation affording the congenial soil upon which
scholarship and letters flourished, it was in reality&mdash;to
use Erasmus’s own favourite expression about the movement&mdash;a
“catastrophe,” in which was overwhelmed the
real progress of the previous century. The state of the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, before and after
the period of religious change, is an eloquent testimony
as to its effect on learning in general; whilst the differences
of opinion in religious matters to which the
Reformation gave rise, at once put a stop to the international
character of the foreign universities. English
names forthwith disappeared from the students’ lists at
the great centres of learning in France and Italy, an
obvious misfortune, which had a disastrous effect on
English scholarship; the opening up of the schools of
the reformed churches of Germany in no wise compensating
for the international training hitherto received by
most English scholars of eminence.</p>

<p>In art and architecture, too, in the second half of
the fifteenth century and the beginning of the sixteenth,
there was manifested an activity in England which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
without a parallel. There never was a period in which
such life and energy was displayed in the building and
adornment of churches of all kinds as on the very eve
of the Reformation. Not in one part of the country
only, nor in regard only to the greater churches, was
this characteristic activity shown, but throughout the
length and breadth of England the walls of our great
cathedrals and minsters, and well-nigh those of every
little parish church in the land, still bear their testimony
to what was done out of love for God’s house during
the period in question by the English people. Moreover,
by the aid of the existing accounts and inventories
it can be proved to demonstration that it was a work
which then, more than at any other period of our
national existence, appealed to the people at large and
was carried out by them. No longer, as in earlier
times, was the building and beautifying of God’s house
left in this period to some great noble benefactor or
rich landowner. During the fifteenth century the
people were themselves concerned with the work,
initiated it, found the means to carry it out, and superintended
it in all its details.</p>

<p>The same may be said of art. The work of adorning
the walls of the churches with paintings and frescoes,
the work of filling in the tracery of the windows with
pictured glass, the work of setting up, and carving, and
painting, and decorating; the making of screens, and
stalls, and altars, all during this period, and right up to
the eve of the change, was in every sense popular. It
was the people who carried out these works, and evidently
for the sole reason because they loved to beautify
their churches, which were, in a way now somewhat
difficult to realise, the centre no less of their lives than of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
their religion. Popular art grows, and only grows luxuriantly,
upon a religious soil; and under the inspiration
of a popular enthusiasm the parish churches of England
became, if we may judge from the evidence of the
wills, accounts, and inventories which still survive, not
merely sanctuaries, but veritable picture galleries, teaching
the poor and unlettered the history and doctrine of
their religion. Nor were the pictures themselves the
miserable daubs which some have suggested. The
stained-glass windows were not only multiplied in the
churches of England during this period, but by those
best able to judge, the time between 1480 and 1520
has been regarded as the golden age of the art; and as
regards the frescoes and decorations themselves, there
is evidence of the existence in England of a high proficiency,
both in design and execution, before the
Reformation. Two examples may be taken to attest
the truth of this: the series of paintings against which
the stalls in Eton College Chapel are now placed, and
the pictures on the walls of the Lady Chapel at Winchester,
now unfortunately destroyed by the whitewash
with which they had been covered on the change of
religion. Those who had the opportunity of examining
the former series, when many years ago they were uncovered
on the temporary removal of the stalls, have
testified to their intrinsic merit. Indeed, they appeared
to the best judges of the time as being so excellent in
drawing and colour that on their authority they were
long supposed to have been the work of some unknown
Italian artist of the school of Giotto. By a fortunate
discovery of Mr. J. Willis Clarke, however, it is now
known that both these and the Winchester series were
in reality executed by an Englishman, named Baker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The same is true with regard to decoration and
carving work. In screen-work, the Perpendicular
period is allowed to have excelled all others, both in
the lavish amount of the ornament as well as in the
style of decoration. One who has paid much attention
to this subject says: “During this period, the
screen-work was usually enriched by gilding and
painting, or was ‘depensiled,’ as the phrase runs,
and many curious works of the limner’s art may still
be seen in the churches of Norfolk and Suffolk. In
Sussex, the screens of Brighton and Horsham may
be cited as painted screens of beauty and merit, both
having been thus ornamented in a profuse and costly
manner, and each bore figures of saints in their
panels.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The churchwardens’ accounts, too, show
that the work of thus decorating the English parish
churches was in full operation up to the very eve of
the religious changes. In these truthful pictures of
parochial life, we may see the people and their representatives
busily engaged in collecting the necessary
money, and in superintending the work of setting up
altars and statues and paintings, and in hiring carvers
and decorators to enrich what their ancestors had
provided for God’s house. It was the age, too, of
organ-making and bell-founding, and there is hardly
a record of any parish church at this time which does
not show considerable sums of money spent upon these.
From the middle of the fifteenth century to the period
described as “the great pillage,” music, too, had made
great progress in England, and the renown of the
English school had spread over Europe. Musical
compositions had multiplied in a wonderful way, and
before the close of the fifteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> “prick song,”
or part music, is very frequently found in the inventories
of our English parish churches. In fact, it has
been recently shown that much of the music of the
boasted school of ecclesiastical music to which the
English Reformation had been thought to have given
birth, is, in reality, music adapted to the new English
services, from Latin originals, which had been inspired
by the ancient offices of the Church. Most of the
“prick song” masses and other musical compositions
were destroyed in the wholesale destruction which
accompanied the religious changes, but sufficient remains
to show that the English pre-Reformation school
of music was second to none in Europe. The reputation
of some of its chief masters, like Dunstable, Tallis,
and Bird, had spread to other countries, and their
works had been used and studied, even in that land
of song, Italy.</p>

<p>A dispassionate consideration of the period preceding
the great religious upheaval of the sixteenth century
will, it can hardly be doubted, lead the inquirer to
conclude that it was not in any sense an age of
stagnation, discontent, and darkness. Letters, art,
architecture, painting, and music, under the distinct
patronage of the Church, had made great and steady
progress before the advent of the new ideas. Moreover,
those who will examine the old parish records
cannot fail to see that up to the very eve of the changes,
the old religion had not lost its hold upon the minds
and affections of the people at large. And one thing
is absolutely clear, that it was not the Reformation
movement which brought to the world in its train the
blessings of education, and the arts of civilisation.
What it did for all these is written plainly enough in
the history of that period of change and destruction.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE REVIVAL OF LETTERS IN ENGLAND</span></h2>

<p>The story of the English literary revival in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries is of no little interest and
importance. The full history of the movement would
form the fitting theme of an entire volume; but the
real facts are so contrary to much that is commonly
believed about our English renaissance of letters, that
some brief account is necessary, if we would rightly
understand the attitude of men’s minds on the eve of
the Reformation. At the outset, it is useful to recall the
limits of this English renaissance. Judged by what is
known of the movement in Italy, the land of its origin,
the word “renaissance” is usually understood to denote
not only the adoption of the learning and intellectual
culture of ancient Greece and Rome by the leaders
of thought in the Western World during the period
in question, but an almost servile following of classical
models, the absorption of the pagan spirit and the
adoption of pagan modes of expression so fully, as
certainly to obscure, if it did not frequently positively
obliterate, Christian sentiment and Christian ideals. In
this sense, it is pleasing to think, the renaissance was
unknown in England. So far, however, as the revival
of learning is concerned, England bore its part in, if
indeed it may not be said to have been in the forefront
of, the movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>This has, perhaps, hardly been realised as it should
be. That the sixteenth century witnessed a remarkable
awakening of minds, a broadening of intellectual interests,
and a considerable advance in general culture,
has long been known and acknowledged. There is
little doubt, however, that the date usually assigned
both for the dawning of the light and for the time
of its full development is altogether too late; whilst
the circumstances which fostered the growth of the
movement have apparently been commonly misunderstood,
and the chief agents in initiating it altogether
ignored. The great period of the reawakening would
ordinarily be placed without hesitation in post-Reformation
times, and writers of all shades of opinion have
joined in attributing the revival of English letters to
the freedom of minds and hearts purchased by the
overthrow of the old ecclesiastical system, and their
emancipation from the narrowing and withering effects
of mediævalism.</p>

<p>On the assumption that the only possible attitude
of English churchmen on the eve of the great religious
changes would be one of uncompromising hostility to
learning and letters, many have come to regard the one,
not as inseparably connected with the other, but the
secular as the outcome of the religious movement. The
undisguised opposition of the clergy to the “New Learning”
is spoken of as sufficient proof of the Church’s
dislike of learning in general, and its determination to
check the nation’s aspirations to profit by the general
classical revival. This assumption is based upon a complete
misapprehension as to what was then the meaning
of the term “New Learning.” It was in no sense connected
with the revival of letters, or with what is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
understood by learning and culture; but it was in the
Reformation days a well-recognised expression used to
denote the novel religious teachings of Luther and his
followers.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Uncompromising hostility to such novelties,
no doubt, marked the religious attitude of many, who
were at the same time the most strenuous advocates of
the renaissance of letters. This is so obvious in the
works of the period, that were it not for the common
misuse of the expression at the present day, and for the
fact that opposition to the “New Learning” is assumed
on all hands to represent hostility to letters, rather than
to novel teachings in religious matters, there would be
no need to furnish examples of its real use in the period
in question. As it is, some instances taken from the
works of that time become almost a necessity, if we
would understand the true position of many of the chief
actors at this period of our history.</p>

<p>Roger Edgworth, a preacher, for instance, after
speaking of those who “so arrogantly glory in their
learning, had by study in the English Bible, and in
these seditious English books that have been sent over
from our English runagates now abiding with Luther
in Saxony,” praises the simple-hearted faith that was
accepted unquestioned by all “before this wicked ‘New
Learning’ arose in Saxony and came over into England
amongst us.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>From the preface of <i>The Praier and Complaynte of the
Ploweman</i>, dated February 1531, it is equally clear
that the expression “New Learning” was then understood
only of religious teaching. Like the Scribes and
Pharisees in the time of Our Lord, the author says, the
bishops and priests are calling out: “What ‘New Learning’
is it? These fellows teach new learning: these
are they that trouble all the world with their new
learning?… Even now after the same manner, our
holy bishops with all their ragman’s roll are of the same
sort.… They defame, slander, and persecute the
word and the preachers and followers of it, with the
selfsame names, calling it ‘New Learning’ and them
‘new masters.’”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The same meaning was popularly attached to the
words even after the close of the reign of Henry VIII.
A book published in King Edward’s reign, to instruct
the people “concerning the king’s majesty’s proceedings
in the communion,” bears the title, <i>The olde Faith of Great
Brittayne and the new learning of England</i>. It is, of course,
true, that the author sets himself to show that the reformed
doctrines were the old teachings of the Christian
Church, and that, when St. Gregory sent St. Augustine
over into England, “the new learning was brought into
this realm, of which we see much yet remaining in the
Church at the present day.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But this fact rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
emphasises than in any way obscures the common
understanding of the expression “New Learning,” since
the whole intent of the author is to show that the
upholders of the old ecclesiastical system were the real
maintainers of a “New Learning” brought from Rome
by St. Augustine, and not the Lutherans. The same
appears equally clearly in a work by Urbanus Regius,
which was translated and published by William Turner
in 1537, and called <i>A comparison betwene the old learnynge
and the newe</i>. As the translator says at the beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Some ther be that do defye</div>
<div class="verse">All that is newe and ever do crye</div>
<div class="verse">The olde is better, away with the new</div>
<div class="verse">Because it is false, and the olde is true.</div>
<div class="verse">Let them this booke reade and beholde,</div>
<div class="verse">For it preferreth the learning most olde.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the author of the previous volume quoted, so
Urbanus Regius compares the exclamation of the Jews
against our Lord: “What new learning is this?” with
the objection, “What is this new doctrine?” made by
the Catholics against the novel religious teaching of
Luther and his followers. “This,” they say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> “is the
new doctrine lately devised and furnished in the shops
and workhouses of heretics. Let us abide still in our
old faith.… Wherefore,” continues the author, “I,
doing the office of Christian brother, have made a comparison
between the ‘New Learning’ and the olden,
whereby, dear brother, you may easily know whether
we are called worthily or unworthily the preachers of
the ‘New Learning.’ For so did they call us of late.”
He then proceeds to compare under various headings
what he again and again calls “the New Learning” and
“the Old Learning.” For example, according to the
former, people are taught that the Sacraments bring
grace to the soul; according to the latter, faith alone is
needful. According to the former, Christ is present
wholly under each kind of bread and wine, the mass is
a sacrifice for the living and the dead, and “oblation is
made in the person of the whole church”; according
to the latter, the Supper is a memorial only of Christ’s
death, “and not a sacrifice, but a remembrance of the
sacrifice that was once offered up on the cross,” and that
“all oblations except that of our Lord are vain and void.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In view of passages such as the above, and in the
absence of any contemporary evidence of the use of
the expression to denote the revival of letters, it is
obvious that any judgment as to a general hostility of
the clergy to learning based upon their admitted opposition
to what was then called the “New Learning”
cannot seriously be maintained. It would seem, moreover,
that the religious position of many ecclesiastics and
laymen has been completely misunderstood by the meaning
now so commonly assigned to the expression. Men
like Erasmus, Colet, and to a great extent, More himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
have been regarded, to say the least, as at heart very
lukewarm adherents of the Church, precisely because of
their strong advocacy of the movement known as the
literary revival, which, identified by modern writers with
the “New Learning,” was, it is wrongly assumed, condemned
by orthodox churchmen. The Reformers are
thus made the champions of learning; Catholics, the upholders
of ignorance, and the hereditary and bitter foes
of all intellectual improvement. No one, however, saw
more clearly than did Erasmus that the rise of Lutheran
opinions was destined to be the destruction of true
learning, and that the atmosphere of controversy was
not the most fitting to assure its growth. To Richard
Pace he expressed his ardent wish that some kindly
<i>Deus ex machinâ</i> would put an end to the whole
Lutheran agitation, for it had most certainly brought
upon the humanist movement unmerited hatred.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In
subsequent letters he rejects the idea that the two,
the Lutheran and the humanist movements, had anything
whatever in common; asserting that even Luther
himself had never claimed to found his revolt against
the Church on the principles of scholarship and learning.
To him, the storm of the Reformation appeared&mdash;so
far as concerned the revival of learning&mdash;as a
catastrophe. Had the tempest not risen, he had the
best expectations of a general literary renaissance and
of witnessing a revival of interest in Biblical and
patristic studies among churchmen. It was the breath
of bitter and endless controversy initiated in the
Lutheran revolt and the consequent misunderstandings
and enmities which withered his hopes.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>There remains, however, the broader question as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to the real position of the ecclesiastical authorities
generally, in regard to the revival of learning. So
far as England is concerned, their attitude is hardly
open to doubt in view of the positive testimony of
Erasmus, which is further borne out by an examination
of the material available for forming a judgment.
This proves beyond all question, not only that the
Church in England on the eve of the change did not
refuse the light, but that, both in its origin and later
development, the movement owed much to the initiative
and encouragement of English churchmen.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to enter very fully into
the subject of the general revival of learning in Europe
during the course of the fifteenth century. At the very
beginning of that period what Gibbon calls “a new
and perpetual flame” was enkindled in Italy. As in
the thirteenth century, so then it was the study of the
literature and culture of ancient Greece that re-enkindled
the lamp of learning in the Western World. Few
things, indeed, are more remarkable than the influence
of Greek forms and models on the Western World.
The very language seems as if destined by Providence
to do for the Christian nations of Europe what in
earlier ages it had done for pagan Rome. As Dr.
Döllinger has pointed out, this is “a fact of immense
importance, which even in these days it is worth while
to weigh and place in its proper light,” since “the
whole of modern civilisation and culture is derived
from Greek sources. Intellectually we are the offspring
of the union of the ancient Greek classics with
Hellenised Judaism.” One thing is clear on the page
of history: that the era of great intellectual activity
synchronised with re-awakened interests in the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
classics and Greek language in such a way that the
study of Greek may conveniently be taken as representing
a general revival of letters.</p>

<p>By the close of the fourteenth century, the ever-increasing
impotence of the Imperial sway on the
Bosphorus, and the ever-growing influence of the
Turk, compelled the Greek emperors to look to Western
Christians for help to arrest the power of the infidels,
which, like a flood, threatened to overwhelm the Eastern
empire. Three emperors in succession journeyed into
the Western world to implore assistance in their dire
necessity, and though their efforts failed to save Constantinople,
the historian detects in these pilgrimages of
Greeks to the Courts of Europe the providential influence
which brought about the renaissance of letters.
“The travels of the three emperors,” writes Gibbon,
“were unavailing for their temporal, or perhaps their
spiritual salvation, but they were productive of a beneficial
consequence, the revival of the Greek learning in
Italy, from whence it was propagated to the last nations
of the West and North.”</p>

<p>What is true of Italy may well be true of other
countries and places. The second of these pilgrim
emperors, Manuel, the son and successor of Palæologus,
crossed the Alps, and after a stay in Paris, came over
the sea into England. In December 1400 he landed
at Dover, and was, with a large retinue of Greeks,
entertained at the monastery of Christchurch, Canterbury.
It requires little stretch of imagination to suppose
that the memory of such a visit would have lingered
long in the cloister of Canterbury, and it is hardly
perhaps by chance that it is here that half a century
later are to be found the first serious indications of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
revival of Greek studies. Moreover, it is evident that
other Greek envoys followed in subsequent times, and
even the great master and prodigy of learning, Manuel
Chrysoloras himself, found his way to our shores, and
it is hardly an assumption, in view of the position of
Canterbury&mdash;on the high-road from Dover to London&mdash;to
suppose to Christchurch also.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It was from his
arrival in Italy, in 1396, that may be dated the first
commencement of systematic study of the Greek classics
in the West. The year 1408 is given for his visit to
England.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>There are indications early in the fifteenth century
of a stirring of the waters in this country. Guarini, a
pupil of Chrysoloras, became a teacher of fame at
Ferrara, where he gathered round him a school of
disciples which included several Englishmen. Such were
Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Robert Fleming, a learned
ecclesiastic; John Free, John Gundthorpe, and William
Gray, Bishop of Ely; whilst another Italian, Aretino,
attracted by his fame another celebrated Englishman,
Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, to his classes. These,
however, were individual cases, and their studies, and
even the books they brought back, led to little in the
way of systematic work in England at the old classical
models. The fall of Constantinople in 1453 gave the
required stimulus here, as in Italy. Among the fugitives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
were many Greek scholars of eminence, such as
Chalcocondylas, Andronicus, Constantine and John Lascaris,
who quickly made the schools of Italy famous by
their teaching. Very soon the fame of the new masters
spread to other countries, and students from all parts of
the Western World found their way to their lecture-halls
in Rome and the other teaching centres established
in the chief cities of Northern Italy.</p>

<p>First among the scholars who repaired thither from
England to drink in the learning of ancient Greece and
bring back to their country the new spirit, we must
place two Canterbury monks named Selling and Hadley.
Born somewhere about 1430, William Selling became
a monk at Christchurch, Canterbury, somewhere about
1448. There seems some evidence to show that his
family name was Tyll, and that, as was frequently, if
not generally, the case, on his entering into religion, he
adopted the name of Selling from his birthplace, some
five miles from Faversham in Kent.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is probable
that Selling, after having passed through the claustral
school at Canterbury, on entering the Benedictine
Order was sent to finish his studies at Canterbury
College, Oxford. Here he certainly was in 1450,
for in that year he writes a long and what is described
as an elegant letter as a student at Canterbury College
to his Prior, Thomas Goldstone, at Christchurch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He was ordained priest, and celebrated
his first mass at Canterbury in September 1456.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In 1464 William Selling obtained leave of his Prior
and convent to go with a companion, William Hadley,
to study in the foreign universities for three years,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
during which time they visited and sat under the most
celebrated teachers at Padua, Bologna, and Rome.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
At Bologna, according to Leland, Selling was the pupil
of the celebrated Politian, “with whom, on account of
his aptitude in acquiring the classical elegance of ancient
tongues, he formed a familiar and lasting friendship.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
In 1466 and 1467 we find the monks, Selling and his
companion Hadley, at Bologna, where apparently the
readers in Greek then were Lionorus and Andronicus,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and where, on the 22nd March 1466, Selling took his
degree in theology, his companion taking his in the
March of the following year.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Of this period of work, Leland says:&mdash;“His studies
progressed. He indeed imbued himself with Greek;
everywhere he industriously and at great expense
collected many Greek books. Nor was his care less
in procuring old Latin MSS., which shortly after he
took with him, as the most estimable treasures, on his
return to Canterbury.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>His obituary notice in the Christchurch Necrology
recites not only his excellence in learning, classical and
theological, but what he had done to make his monastery
at Canterbury a real house of studies. He decorated
the library over the Priests’ Chapel, adding to the books,
and assigned it “for the use of those specially given to
study, which he encouraged and cherished with wonderful
watchfulness and affection.” The eastern cloister
also he fitted with glass and new desks, “called carrels,”
for the use of the studious brethren.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>After the sojourn of the two Canterbury monks in
Italy, they returned to their home at Christchurch.
Selling, however, did not remain there long, for on
October 3, 1469, we find him setting out again for
Rome<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in company with another monk, Reginald
Goldstone, also an Oxford student. This visit was
on business connected with his monastery, and did
not apparently keep him long away from England,
for there is evidence that sometime before the election
of Selling to the Priorship at Canterbury, which was
in 1472, he was again at his monastery. Characteristically,
his letter introducing William Worcester, the
antiquary, to a merchant of Lucca who had a copy
of Livy’s <i>Decades</i> for sale, manifests his great and continued
interest in classical literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>At Canterbury, Selling must have established the
teaching of Greek on systematic lines, and it is certainly
from this monastic school as a centre, that the study
spread to other parts of England. William Worcester,
keenly alive to the classical revival, as his note-books
show, tells us of “certain Greek terminations as taught
by Doctor Selling of Christchurch, Canterbury,” and
likewise sets down the pronunciation of the Greek vowels
with examples evidently on the same authority.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Selling’s long priorship, extending from 1472 to
1495, would have enabled him to consolidate the work
of this literary renaissance which he had so much at
heart.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The most celebrated of all his pupils was, of
course, Linacre. Born, according to Caius, at Canterbury,
he received his first instruction in the monastic
school there, and his first lessons in the classics and
Greek from Selling himself. Probably through the personal
interest taken in this youth of great promise by
Prior Selling, he was sent to Oxford about 1480.
Those who have seriously examined the matter believe
that the first years of his Oxford life were spent by
Linacre at the Canterbury College, which was connected
with Christchurch monastery, and which, though
primarily intended for monks, also afforded a place of
quiet study to others who were able to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
admission.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Thus, in later years, Sir Thomas More, no
doubt through his father’s connection with the monastery
of Christchurch, Canterbury, of which house he
was a “confrater,” became a student at the monks’
college at Oxford. In later years Sir Thomas himself,
when Chancellor of England, perpetuated the memory
of his life-long connection with the monks of Canterbury
by enrolling his name also on the fraternity lists
of that house.</p>

<p>Linacre, in 1484, became a Fellow of All Souls’
College, but evidently he did not lose touch with his
old friends at Canterbury, for, in 1486, Prior Selling
being appointed one of the ambassadors of Henry VII.
to the Pope, he invited his former pupil to accompany
him to Italy, in order to profit by the teaching of the
great humanist masters at the universities there. Prior
Selling took him probably as far as Florence, and
introduced him to his own old master and friend,
Angelo Politian, who was then engaged in instructing
the children of Lorenzo de Medici. Through Selling’s
interest, Linacre was permitted to share in their lessons,
and there are letters showing that the younger son,
when in after years he became Pope, as Leo X., was
not unmindful of his early companionship with the
English scholar.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> From Politian, Linacre acquired a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
purity of style in Latin which makes him celebrated
even among the celebrated men of his time. Greek
he learnt from Demetrius Chalcocondylas, who was
then, like Politian, engaged in teaching the children of
Lorenzo de Medici.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>From Florence, Linacre passed on to Rome, where
he gained many friends among the great humanists of
the day. One day, when examining the manuscripts
of the Vatican Library for classics, and engaged in
reading the <i>Phædo</i> of Plato, Hermolaus Barbarus came
up and politely expressed his belief that the youth had
no claim, as he had himself, to the title Barbarus, if
it were lawful to judge from his choice of a book.
Linacre at once, from the happy compliment, recognised
the speaker, and this chance interview led to a life-long
friendship between the Englishman and one of the
great masters of classical literature.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>After Linacre had been in Italy for a year or more,
a youth whom he had known at Oxford, William Grocyn,
was induced to come and share with him the benefit of
the training in literature then to be obtained only in
Italy. On his return in 1492, Grocyn became lecturer
at Exeter College, Oxford, and among his pupils in
Greek were Sir Thomas More<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and Erasmus. He was
a graduate in theology, and was chosen by Dean Colet
to give lectures at St. Paul’s and subsequently appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by Archbishop Warham, Master or Guardian of the
collegiate church of Maidstone.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Erasmus describes
him as “a man of most rigidly upright life, almost
superstitiously observant of ecclesiastical custom, versed
in every nicety of scholastic theology, by nature of the
most acute judgment, and, in a word, fully instructed
in every kind of learning.”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Linacre, after a distinguished course in the medical
schools of Padua, returned to Oxford, and in 1501
became tutor to Prince Arthur. On the accession of
Henry VIII. he was appointed physician to the court,
and could count all the distinguished men of the day,
Wolsey, Warham, Fox, and the rest, among his patients;
and Erasmus, Sir Thomas More, and Queen Mary
among his pupils in letters. In his early life, entering
the clerical state, he had held ecclesiastical preferment;
in advanced years he received priest’s orders, and devoted
the evening of his life to a pious preparation for
his end.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Grocyn and Linacre are usually regarded as the
pioneers of the revival of letters. But, as already
pointed out, the first to cross the Alps from England
in search for the new light, to convey it back to England,
and to hand it on to Grocyn and Linacre, were
William Selling, and his companion, William Hadley.
Thus, the real pioneers in the English renaissance were
the two monks of Christchurch, and, some years after,
the two ecclesiastics, Grocyn and Linacre.</p>

<p>Selling, even after his election to the priorship of
Canterbury, continued to occupy a distinguished place
both in the political world and in the world of letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
He was chosen, though only the fifth member of the
embassy sent by Henry VII. on his accession to the
Pope, to act as orator, and in that capacity delivered
a Latin oration before the Pope and Cardinals.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>He was also and subsequently sent with others by
Henry on an embassy to the French king, in which
he also fulfilled the function of spokesman, making
what is described as “a most elegant oration.”</p>

<p>That as Prior, Selling kept up his interest in the
literary revival is clear from the terms of his obituary
notice. There exists, moreover, a translation made
by him after his return from his embassy to Rome,
when he took his youthful protégé, Linacre, and placed
him under Chalcocondylas and Politian in Florence,
which seems to prove that the renewal of his intimacy
with the great humanist masters of Italy had inspired
him with a desire to continue his literary work. Even
in the midst of constant calls upon him, which the high
office of Prior of Canterbury necessitated, he found time
to translate a sermon of St. John Chrysostom from the
Greek, two copies of which still remain in the British
Museum.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This is dated 1488; and it is probably
the first example of any Greek work put into Latin
in England in the early days of the English renaissance
of letters. The very volume (Add. MS. 15,673) in
which one copy of this translation is found shows
by the style of the writing, and other indications, the
Italian influences at work in Canterbury in the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of Selling’s succession at the close of the fifteenth
century; and also the intercourse which the monastery
there kept up with the foreign humanists.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say more about the precious
volumes of the classics and the other manuscripts which
Selling collected on his travels. Many of them perished,
with that most rare work, Cicero’s <i>De Republica</i>, in
the fire caused by the carelessness of some of Henry
VIII.’s visitors on the eve of the dissolution of Selling’s
old monastery at Canterbury. Some, like the great
Greek commentaries of St. Cyril on the Prophets, were
rescued half burnt from the flames; “others, by some
good chance,” says Leland, “had been removed; amongst
these were the commentaries of St. Basil the Great on
Isaias, the works of Synesius and other Greek codices.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Quite recently it has been recognised that the complete
Homer and the plays of Euripides in Corpus Christi
College library at Cambridge, which tradition had
associated with the name of Archbishop Theodore in
the seventh century, are in reality both fifteenth-century
manuscripts; and as they formed, undoubtedly, part of
the library at Christchurch, Canterbury, it is hardly too
much to suppose that they were some of the treasures
brought back by Prior Selling from Italy. The same
may probably be said of a Livy, a fifteenth-century
Greek Psalter, and a copy of the Psalms in Hebrew and
Latin, in Trinity College Library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Prior Selling’s influence, moreover, extended beyond
the walls of his own house, and can be traced to others
besides his old pupil, and, as some think, relative, Linacre.
Among the friendships he had formed whilst at
Padua was that of a young ecclesiastical student, Thomas
Langton, with whom he was subsequently at Rome.
Langton was employed in diplomatic business by
King Edward IV., and whilst in France, through his
friendship for Prior Selling, obtained some favour from
the French king for the monastery of Canterbury. In
return for this the monks offered him a living in
London.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Prior Selling, on one occasion at least,
drafted the sermon which Dr. Langton was to deliver
as prolocutor in the Convocation of the Canterbury
Province.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In 1483 Langton became Bishop of Winchester,
and “such was his love of letters” that he
established in his own house a <i>schola domestica</i> for boys,
and himself used to preside in the evening at the lessons.
One youth especially attracted his attention by his
music. This was Richard Pace, afterwards renowned
as a classical scholar and diplomatist. Bishop Langton
recognised his abilities, and forthwith despatched him
to Italy, paying all his expenses at the universities of
Padua and Rome.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> At the former place, he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
“When as a youth I began to work at my humanities,
I was assisted by Cuthbert Tunstall and William
Latimer, men most illustrious and excelling in every
branch of learning, whose prudence, probity, and
integrity were such that it were hard to say whether
their learning excelled their high moral character, or
their uprightness their learning.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>At this university he was taught by Leonicus and
by Leonicenus, the friend and correspondent of Politian:
“Men,” he says, as being unable to give higher praise,
“like Tunstall and Latimer.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Passing on to Bologna
he sat at the feet of Paul Bombasius, “who was then
explaining every best author to large audiences.” Subsequently,
at Rome, he formed a lasting friendship with
William Stokesley, whom he describes as “his best
friend on earth; a man of the keenest judgment, excellent,
and indeed marvellous, in theology and philosophy,
and not only skilled in Greek and Latin, but
possessed of some knowledge of Hebrew,” whose great
regret was that he had not earlier in life realised the
power of the Greek language.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> At Ferrara, too, Pace
first met Erasmus, and he warmly acknowledges his indebtedness
to the influence of this great humanist.</p>

<p>In 1509, Richard Pace accompanied Cardinal Bainbridge
to Rome, and was with him when the cardinal
died, or was murdered, there in 1514. Whilst in the
Eternal City, “urged to the study by that most upright
and learned man, William Latimer,” he searched the
Pope’s library for books of music, and found a great
number of works on the subject. The cardinal’s death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
put a stop to his investigations; but he had seen sufficient
to be able to say that to study the matter properly
a man must know Greek and get to the library of the
Pope, where there were many and the best books on
music. “But,” he adds, “I venture to say this, our
English music, if any one will critically examine into
the matter, will be found to display the greatest subtlety
of mind, especially in what is called the introduction of
harmonies, and in this matter to excel ancient music.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow in any detail the story
of the general literary revival in England. Beginning
with Selling, the movement continued to progress down
to the very eve of the religious disputes. That there was
opposition on the part of some who regarded the stirring
of the waters with suspicion was inevitable. More
especially was this the case because during the course
of the literary revival there rose the storm of the great
religious revolt of the sixteenth century, and because the
practical paganism which had resulted from the movement
in Italy was perhaps not unnaturally supposed by
the timorous to be a necessary consequence of a return
to the study of the classics of Greece and Rome. The
opposition sprung generally from a misunderstanding,
and “not so much from any hostility to Greek itself as
from an indifference to any learning.” This Sir Thomas
More expressly declares when writing to urge the Oxford
authorities to repress a band of giddy people who,
calling themselves Trojans, made it their duty to fight
against the <i>Grecians</i>. It is true also that the pulpit was
at times brought into requisition to decry “not only
Greek and Latin studies,” but liberal education of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
any kind.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But, so far as England is concerned, this
opposition to the revival of letters, even on the score of
the danger likely to come either to faith or morals, was,
when all is said, slight, and through the influence of
More, Fisher, and the king himself, easily subdued.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The main fact, moreover, cannot be gainsaid, namely,
that the chief ecclesiastics of the day, Wolsey, Warham,
Fisher, Tunstall, Langton, Stokesley, Fox, Selling,
Grocyn, Whitford, Linacre, Colet, Pace, William Latimer,
and Thomas Lupset,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to name only the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
distinguished, were not only ardent humanists, but
thorough and practical churchmen. Of the laymen,
whether foreigners or Englishmen, whose names are
associated with the renaissance of letters in this country,
such as, for example, the distinguished scholar Ludovico
Vives, the two Lillys, Sir Thomas More, John Clement,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
and other members of More’s family, there can be no
shadow of doubt about their dispositions towards the
ancient ecclesiastical régime. A Venetian traveller, in
1500, thus records what he had noticed as to the attitude
of ecclesiastics generally towards learning:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>“Few,
excepting the clergy, are addicted to the study of letters,
and this is the reason why any one who has any learning,
though he may be a layman, is called a <i>clerk</i>. And
yet they have great advantages for study, there being
two general universities in the kingdom, Oxford and
Cambridge, in which there are many colleges founded
for the maintenance of poor scholars. And your magnificence
(the Doge of Venice) lodged at one named
Magdalen, in the University of Oxford, of which, as the
founders having been prelates, so the scholars also are
ecclesiastics.”</p>

<p>It was in England, and almost entirely among the
ecclesiastics of England, that Erasmus found his chief
support. “This England of yours,” he writes to Colet
in 1498, “this England, dear to me on many accounts,
is above all most beloved because it abounds in what
to me is the best of all, men deeply learned in letters.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Nor did he change his opinion on a closer acquaintance.
In 1517, to Richard Pace he wrote from
Louvain in regret at leaving a country which he had
come to regard as the best hope of the literary revival:&mdash;“Oh,
how truly happy is your land of England, the
seat and stronghold of the best studies and the highest
virtue! I congratulate you, my friend Pace, on having
such a king, and I congratulate the king whose country
is rendered illustrious by so many brilliant men of
ability. On both scores I congratulate this England
of yours, for though fortunate for many other reasons,
on this score no other land can compete with it.”<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>When William Latimer said in 1518 that Bishop
Fisher wished to study Greek for Biblical purposes,
and that he thought of trying to get a master from Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Erasmus, whilst applauding the bishop’s intention as
likely to encourage younger men to take up the
study, told Latimer that such men were not easy to find
in Italy. “If I may openly say my mind,” he adds,
“if I had Linacre, or Tunstall, for a master (for of yourself
I say nothing), I would not wish for any Italian.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Not to go into more lengthy details, there is, it
must be admitted, abundant evidence to show that there
was in the religious houses of England, no less than in
the universities, a stirring of the waters, and a readiness
to profit by the real advance made in education
and scholarship. The name of Prior Charnock, the
friend of Colet and Erasmus at Oxford, is known to
all. But there are others with even greater claim than
he to be considered leaders in the movement. There
is distinct evidence of scholarship at Reading, at Ramsey,
at Glastonbury, and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The last-named
house, Glastonbury, was ruled by Abbot Bere, to
whose criticism Erasmus desired to submit his translation
of the New Testament from the Greek. Bere
himself had passed some time, with distinction, in Italy,
had been sent on more than one embassy by the king,
and had been chosen by Henry VII. to invest the Duke
of Urbino with the Order of the Garter, and to make
the required oration on that occasion.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He had given
other evidence also of the way the new spirit that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
been enkindled in Italy had entered into his soul. It
was through Abbot Bere’s generosity that Richard Pace,
whom Erasmus calls “the half of his soul,” was enabled
to pursue his studies in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Glastonbury was apparently
a soil well prepared for the seed-time, for even
in the days of Abbot Bere’s predecessor, Abbot John
Selwood, there is evidence to show that the religious
were not altogether out of touch with the movement.
The abbot himself presented one of the monks with
a copy of John Free’s translation from the Greek
of <i>Synesius de laude Calvitii</i>. The volume is written
by an Italian scribe, and contains in the introductory
matter a letter to the translator from Omnibonus Leonicensis,
dated at Vicenza in 1461, as well as a preface
or letter by Free to John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>At St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, also, we find, even
amid the ruins of its desolation, traces of the same
spirit which pervaded the neighbouring cloister of
Christchurch. The antiquary Twyne declares that he
had been intimately acquainted with the last abbot,
whom he knew to have been deeply interested in the
literary movement. He describes his friend as often
manifesting in conversation his interest in and knowledge
of the ancient classical authors. He says that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
this monk was the personal friend of Ludovico Vives,
and that he sent over the sea one of his subjects at St.
Augustine’s, John Digon, whom he subsequently made
prior of his monastery, to the schools of Louvain, in
order that he might profit by the teaching of that
celebrated Spanish humanist.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Beyond the foregoing particular instances of the
real mind of English ecclesiastics towards the revival
of studies, the official registers of the Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge furnish us with evidence of the
general attitude of approval adopted by the Church
authorities in England. Unfortunately, gaps in the
Register of Graduates at Oxford for the second half
of the fifteenth century do not enable us to gauge
the full extent of the revival, but there is sufficient
evidence that the renaissance had taken place. In the
eleven years, from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1449 to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1459, for which
the entries exist, the average number of degrees taken
by all students was 91.5. From 1506, when the
registers begin again, to 1535, when the commencement
of operations against the monastic houses
seemed to indicate the advent of grave religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
changes, the average number of yearly degrees granted
was 127. In 1506 the number had risen to 216, and
only in very few of the subsequent years had the
average fallen below 100. From 108 in 1535, the
number of graduates fell in 1536 to only 44; and the
average for the subsequent years of the reign of
Henry VIII. was less than 57. From 1548 to 1553,
that is, during the reign of Edward VI., the average of
graduates was barely 33, but it rose again, whilst Mary
was on the throne, to 70.</p>

<p>If the same test be applied to the religious Orders,
it will be found that they likewise equally profited by the
new spirit. During the period from 1449 to 1459 the
Benedictine Order had a yearly average of 4 graduates
at Oxford, the other religious bodies taken together
having 5. In the second period of 1506-1539 the
Benedictine graduates number 200, and (allowing for
gaps in the register) the Order had thus a yearly average
of 6.75, the average of the other Orders during the same
period being 5.2. If, moreover, the number of the
religious who took degrees be compared with that of
the secular students, it will be found that the former
seem to have more than held their own. During the
time from 1449 to 1459 the members of the regular
Orders were to the rest in the proportion of 1 to 9.5.
In the period of the thirty years immediately preceding
the general dissolution it was as 1 to 9. Interest in learning,
too, was apparently kept up among the religious
Orders to the last. Even with their cloisters falling on
all sides round about them, in the last hour of their
corporate existence, that is in the year 1538-39, some
14 Benedictines took their degrees at Oxford.</p>

<p>In regard to Cambridge, a few notes taken from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
interesting preface to a recent “History of Gonville and
Caius College” will suffice to show that the monks did
not neglect the advantages offered to them in the sister
university.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Gonville Hall, as the college was then
called, was by the statutes of Bishop Bateman closely
connected with the Benedictine Cathedral Priory of
Norwich. Between 1500 and 1523 the early bursars’
accounts give a list of “pensioners,” and these “largely
consisted of monks sent hither from their respective
monasteries for the purpose of study.” These “pensioners
paid for their rooms and their commons, and
shared their meals with the fellows. All the greater
monasteries in East Anglia, such as the Benedictine
Priory at Norwich, the magnificent foundation of Bury,
and (as a large landowner in Norfolk) the Cluniac
House at Lewes, seem generally to have had several
of their younger members in training at our college.
To these must be added the Augustinian Priory of
Westacre, which was mainly frequented (as Dr. Jessopp
tells us) by the sons of the Norfolk gentry.”<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The Visitations of the Norwich Diocese (1492-1532),
edited by Dr. Jessopp for the Camden Society, contain
many references to the monastic students at the university.
In one house, for example, in 1520, the numbers
are short, because “there were three in the university.”
In another case, when a religious house was too poor
to provide the necessary money to support a student
during his college career, it was found by friends of
the monastery, until a few years later, when, on the
funds improving, the house was able to meet the
expenses. This same house, the Priory of Butley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“had a special arrangement with the authorities of
Gonville Hall for the reservation of a suitable room
for their young monks.” One object of sending
members of a monastery to undergo the training of
a university course “was to qualify for teaching the
novices at their own house”; for after they have
graduated and returned to their monastery, we not
infrequently find them described as “<i>idoneus preceptor
pro confratribus</i>”; “<i>idoneus pro noviciis et junioribus</i>,” &amp;c.
Moreover, the possession of a degree on the part of
a religious, as an examination of the lists will show,
often in after life meant some position of trust or high
office in the monastery of the graduate.</p>

<p>Nor was the training then received any light
matter of form; it meant long years of study, and the
possession of a degree was, too, a public testimony
to a certain proficiency in the science of teaching.
Thus, for example, George Mace, a canon of Westacre,
who became a pensioner at Gonville Hall in 1508,
studied arts for five years and canon law for four
years at the university, and continued the latter study
for eight years in his monastery.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> William Hadley, a
religious of the same house, had spent eleven years
in the study of arts and theology;<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and Richard
Brygott, who took his B.D. in 1520, and who subsequently
became Prior of Westacre, had studied two
years and a half in his monastery, two years in Paris,
and seven in Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>“With the Reformation, of course, all this came
to an end,” writes Mr. Venn, and we can well understand
that this sudden stoppage of what, in the aggregate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was a considerable source of supply to the
university, was seriously felt. On the old system, as
we have seen, the promising students were selected
by their monasteries, and supported in college at the
expense of the house. As the author of the interesting
account of Durham Priory says: “If the master did
see that any of them (the novices) were apt to learning,
and did apply his book and had a pregnant wit withal,
then the master did let the prior have intelligence.
Then, straightway after he was sent to Oxford to
school, and there did learn to study divinity.”<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it should be remembered that it was by
means of the assistance received from the monastic
and conventual houses that a very large number of
students were enabled to receive their education at
the universities at all. The episcopal registers testify
to this useful function of the old religious corporations.
The serious diminution in the number of
candidates for ordination, and the no less lamentable
depletion of the national universities, consequent upon
the dissolution of these bodies, attest what had previously
been done by them for the education of the
pastoral clergy. This may be admitted without any
implied approval of the monastic system as it existed.
The fact will be patent to all who will examine into
the available evidence; and the serious diminution in
the number of clergy must be taken as part of the
price paid by the nation for securing the triumph of
the Reformation principles. The state of Oxford
during, say, the reign of Edward VI., is attested by
the degree lists. In the year 1547 and in the year
1550 no student at all graduated, and the historian of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the university has described the lamentable state to
which the schools were reduced. If additional testimony
be needed, it may be found in a sermon of
Roger Edgworth, preached in Queen Mary’s reign.
Speaking of works of piety and pity, much needed in
those days, the speaker advocates charity to the poor
students at the two national universities. “Very pity,”
he says, “moves me to exhort you to mercy and pity
on the poor students in the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge. They were never so few in number, and
yet those that are left are ready to run abroad into
the world and give up their study for very need.
Iniquity is so abundant that charity is all cold. A
man would have pity did he but hear the lamentable
complaints that I heard lately when amongst them.
Would to God I were able to relieve them. This much
I am sure of: in my opinion you cannot bestow your
charity better.” He then goes on to instance his own
case as an example of what used to be done in Catholic
times to help the student in his education. “My
parents sent me to school in my youth, and my good
lord William Smith, sometime Bishop of Lincoln, (was)
my bringer up and ‘exhibitour,’ first at Banbury in the
Grammar School with Master John Stanbridge, and
then at Oxford till I was a Master of Arts and able
to help myself.”</p>

<p>He pleads earnestly that some of his hearers may
be inspired to help the students in the distress to which
they are now reduced, and so help to restore learning to
the position from which it had fallen in late years.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Of the lamentable decay of scholarship as such, the
inevitable, and perhaps necessary, consequence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
religious controversies which occupied men’s minds
and thoughts to the exclusion of all else, it is, of course,
not the place here to dwell upon. All that it is necessary
to do is to point out that the admitted decay and
decline argues a previous period of greater life and
vigour. Even as early as 1545 the Cambridge scholars
petitioned the king for an extension of privileges, as they
feared the total destruction of learning. To endeavour
to save Oxford, it was ordered that every clergyman,
having a benefice to the amount of £100, should out
of his living find at least one scholar at the university.
Bishop Latimer, in Edward VI.’s reign, looked back
with regret to past times “when they helped the
scholars,” for since then “almost no man helpeth to
maintain them.” “Truly,” he said, “it is a pitiful
thing to see the schools so neglected. Schools are
not maintained, scholars have not exhibitions.…
Very few there be that help poor scholars.… It
would pity a man’s heart to hear what I hear of the
state of Cambridge; what it is in Oxford I cannot
tell.… I think there be at this day (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1550) ten
thousand students less than there were within these
twenty years.” In the year 1550, it will be remembered,
there was apparently no degree of any kind
taken at the university of Oxford.</p>

<p>This fact appears patent on this page of history;
that from the time when minds began to exercise
themselves on the thorny subjects which grew up
round about the “great divorce” question, the bright
promises of the revival of learning, which Erasmus
had seen in England, faded away. Greek, it has
been said, may conveniently stand for learning generally;
and Greek studies apparently disappeared in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
religious turmoils which distracted England. With
Mary’s accession, some attempt was made to recover
lost ground, or at least re-enkindle the lamp of learning.
When Sir Thomas Pope refounded Durham
College at Oxford under the name of Trinity, he was
urged by Cardinal Pole, to whom he submitted the
draft of his statutes, “to order Greek to be more
taught there than I have provided. This purpose,”
he says, “I like well, but I fear the times will not
bear it now. I remember when I was a young scholar
at Eton, the Greek tongue was growing apace, the
study of which is now of late much decayed.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The wholesale destruction of the great libraries in
England is an indirect indication of the new spirit
which rose at this time, and which helped for a time
to put an end to the renaissance of letters. When
Mary came to the throne, and quieter times made
the scheme possible, it was seriously proposed to do
something to preserve the remnant of ancient and
learned works that might be left in England after
the wholesale destruction of the preceding years.
The celebrated Dr. Dee drew up a supplication to the
queen, stating that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> “among the many most lamentable
displeasures that have of late happened in this realm,
through the subverting of religious houses and the
dissolution of other assemblies of godly and learned
men, it has been, and among all learned students shall
for ever be, judged not the least calamity, the spoil
and destruction of so many and so notable libraries
wherein lay the treasure of all antiquity, and the everlasting
seeds of continual excellency in learning within
this realm. But although in those days many a precious
jewel and ancient monument did utterly perish
(as at Canterbury that wonderful work of the sage and
eloquent Cicero, <i>De Republica</i>, and in many other places
the like), yet if in time great and speedy diligence be
showed, the remnants of such incredible a store, as well
of writers theological as in all the other liberal sciences,
might yet be saved and recovered, which now in your
Grace’s realm being dispersed and scattered, yea, and
many of them in unlearned men’s hands, still even yet
(in this time of reconciliation) daily perish; and perchance
are purposely by some envious person enclosed
in walls or buried in the ground.”</p>

<p>The scheme which accompanied this letter in 1556
was for the formation of a national library, into which
were to be gathered the original manuscripts still left
in England, which could be purchased or otherwise
obtained, or at least a copy of such as were in private
hands, and which the owners would not part with.
Beyond this, John Dee proposes that copies of the best
manuscripts in Europe should be secured. He mentions
specially the libraries of the Vatican, and of St.
Mark’s, Venice, those at Florence, Bologna, and Vienna,
and offers to go himself, if his expenses are paid, to secure
the transcripts.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The plan, however, came to nothing,
and with Mary’s death, the nation was once more
occupied in the religious controversies, which again
interfered with any real advance in scholarship.</p>

<p>One other point must not be overlooked. Before
the rise of the religious dissensions caused England to
isolate herself from the rest of the Catholic world,
English students were to be found studying in considerable
numbers at the great centres of learning in Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
An immediate result of the change was to put a stop to
this, which had served to keep the country in touch
with the best work being done on the Continent, and
the result of which had been seen in the able English
scholars produced by that means on the eve of the
Reformation.</p>

<p>Taking a broad survey of the whole movement for
the revival of letters in England, it would appear then
certain that whether we regard its origin, or the forces
which contributed to support it, or the men chiefly
concerned in it, it must be confessed that to the
Church and churchmen the country was indebted for
the successes achieved. What put a stop to the
humanist movement here, as it certainly did in Germany,
was the rise of the religious difficulties, which,
under the name of the “New Learning,” was opposed
by those most conspicuous for their championship of
true learning, scholarship, and education.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TWO JURISDICTIONS</span></h2>

<p>The Reformation found men still occupied with questions
as to the limits of ecclesiastical and lay jurisdiction,
which had troubled their minds at various periods during
the previous centuries. It is impossible to read very
deeply into the literature of the period without seeing
that, while on the one hand, all the fundamental principles
of the spiritual jurisdiction of the Church were
fully and freely recognised by all; on the other, a
number of questions, mainly in the broad borderland
of debatable ground between the two, were constantly
being discussed, and not infrequently gave cause for
disagreements and misunderstandings. As in the history
of earlier times, so in the sixteenth century ecclesiastics
clung, perhaps not unnaturally, to what they
regarded as their strict rights, and looked on resistance
to encroachment as a sacred duty. Laymen on the other
part, even when their absolute loyalty to the Church was
undoubted, were found in the ranks of those who claimed
for the State power to decide in matters not strictly pertaining
to the spiritual prerogatives, but which chiefly by
custom had come to be regarded as belonging to ecclesiastical
domain. It is the more important that attention
should be directed in a special manner to these questions,
inasmuch as it will be found, speaking broadly, that the
ultimate success or ill-success of the strictly doctrinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
changes raised in the sixteenth century was determined
by the issue of the discussions raised on the question
of mixed jurisdiction. This may not seem very philosophical,
but in the event it is proved to be roughly
correct. The reason is not very far to seek. In great
measure at least, questions of money and property,
even of national interest and prosperity, were intimately
concerned in the matter in dispute. They touched the
people’s pocket; and whether rightly or wrongly, those
who found the money wished to have a say in its disposal.
One thing cannot fail to strike an inquirer into
the literature of this period: the very small number of
people who were enthusiasts in the doctrinal matters
with which the more ardent reformers occupied themselves.</p>

<p>We are not here concerned with another and more
delicate question as to the papal prerogatives exercised
in England. For clearness’ sake in estimating the
forces which made for change on the eve of the Reformation,
this subject must be examined in connection
with the whole attitude of England to Rome and the
Pope in the sixteenth century. It must, consequently,
be understood that in trying here to illustrate the attitude
of men’s minds at this period to these important
and practical questions, a further point as to the claims
of the Roman Pontiffs in regard to some or all of them
has yet to be considered. Even in examining the
questions at issue between the authorities&mdash;lay and
ecclesiastical&mdash;in the country, the present purpose is
to record rather than to criticise, to set forth the attitude
of mind as it appears in the literature of the period,
rather than to weigh the reasons and judge between
the contending parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The lawyer, Christopher Saint-German, is a contemporary
writer to whom we naturally turn for information
upon the points at issue. He, of course,
takes the layman’s side as to the right of the State
to interfere in all, or in most, questions which arise as
to the dues of clerics, and other temporalities, such as
tithes, &amp;c., which are attached to the spiritual functions
of the clergy. Moreover, beyond claiming the right
for the State so to interfere in the regulation of all
temporalities and kindred matters, Saint-German also
held that in some things in which custom had given
sanction to the then practice, it would be for the good
of the State that it should do so. In his <i>Dyalogue between
a Student of Law and a Doctor of Divinity</i>,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> his views are
put clearly; whilst the Doctor states, though somewhat
lamely perhaps, the position of the clergy.</p>

<p>To take the example of “mortuaries,” upon which
the Parliament had already legislated to the dismay
of some of the ecclesiastical party, who, as it appears,
on the plea that the law was unjust and beyond the
competence of the State authority, tried in various
ways to evade the provisions of the Act, which was
intended to relieve the laity of exactions that, as
they very generally believed, had grown into an abuse.
Christopher Saint-German holds that Parliament was
quite within its rights. The State could, and on occasion
should, legislate as to dues payable to the clergy,
and settle whether ecclesiastics, who claim articles in
kind, or sums of money by prescriptive right, ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in fact to be allowed them. There is, he admits, a
difficulty; he does not think that it would be competent
for the State to prohibit specific gifts to God’s
service, or to say that only “so many tapers shall be
used at a funeral,” or that only so many priests may
be bidden to the burial, or that only so much may be
given in alms. In matters of this kind he does not
think the State has jurisdiction to interfere. “But it
has,” he says, “the plain right to make a law, that
there shall not be given above so many black gowns, or
that there shall be no herald of arms” present, unless it
is the funeral of one “of such a degree,” or that “no
black cloths should be hung in the streets from the house
where the person died, to the church, as is used in
many cities and good towns, or the prohibition of
such other things as are but worldly pomps, and are
rather consolations to the friends that are alive, than
any relief to the departed soul.” In these and such
like things, he says: “I think the Parliament has
authority to pass laws, so as to protect the executors
of wills, and relieve them from the necessity of spending
so much of the inheritance of the deceased man’s
heirs.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>In like manner the lawyer holds that in all strictly
temporal matters, whatever privilege and exemption
the State may allow and has allowed the clergy, it
still possesses the radical power to legislate where
and when it sees fit. It does not in fact by lapse
of time lose the ordinary authority it possesses over
all subjects of the realm in these matters. Thus, for
example, he holds that the State can and should prohibit
all lands in mortmain passing to the Church;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and that, should it appear to be a matter of public
policy, Parliament might prohibit and indeed break
the appropriations of benefices already made to monasteries,
cathedrals, and colleges, and order that they
should return to their original purposes. “The advowson,”
he says, “is a temporal inheritance, and as such
is under the Parliament to order it as it sees cause.”
This principle, he points out, had been practically
admitted when the Parliament, in the fourth year of
Henry IV., cancelled all appropriations of vicarages
which had been made from the beginning of Richard II.’s
reign. It is indeed “good,” he adds, “that the authority
of the Parliament in this should be known, and
that it should cause them to observe such statutes
as are already made, and to distribute some part of
the fruits (of the benefices) among poor parishioners
according to the statute of the twentieth year of King
Richard II.”</p>

<p>In the same way, and for similar reasons, Saint-German
claims that the State has full power to determine
questions of “Sanctuary,” and to legislate as to
“benefit of clergy.” Such matters were, he contends,
only customs of the realm, and in no sense any point
of purely spiritual prerogative. Like every other custom
of the realm, these were subject to revision by the
supreme secular authority. “The Pope by himself,”
he adds, “cannot make any Sanctuary in this realm.”
This question of “Sanctuary” rights was continually
causing difficulties between the lay and the ecclesiastical
authorities. To the legal mind the custom was certainly
dangerous to the well-being of the State, and
made the administration of justice unnecessarily complicated,
especially when ecclesiastics pleaded their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
privileges, and strongly resisted any attempt on the
part of legal officials to ignore them. Cases were
by no means infrequent in the courts in the reigns
of Henry VII. and Henry VIII., which caused more
or less friction between the upholders of the two
views.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> To illustrate the state of conflict on this, in
itself a very minor matter, a trial which took place
in London in the year 1519 is here given in some
detail. One John Savage in that year was charged
with murder. At the time of his arrest he was living
in St. John Street (Clerkenwell), and when brought
to trial pleaded that he had been wrongfully arrested
in a place of Sanctuary belonging to the Priory of St.
John of Jerusalem. To justify his contention and
obtain his liberty, he called on the Prior of the Knights
of St. John to maintain his rights and privileges, and
vindicate this claim of Sanctuary. The prior appeared
and produced the grant of Pope Urban III., made by
Bull dated in 1213, which had been ratified by King
Henry III. He also cited cases in which he alleged
that in the reign of the late King Henry VII. felons,
who had been seized within the precincts, had been
restored to Sanctuary, and he therefore argued that
this case was an infringement of the rights of his
priory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Savage also declared that he was in St. John Street
within the precincts of the priory “pur amendement
de son vie, durant son vie,” when on the 8th of June
an officer, William Rotte, and others took him by force
out of the place, and carried him away to the Tower.
He consequently claimed to be restored to the Sanctuary
from which he had been abducted. Chief-Justice
Fineux, before whom the prisoner had been brought,
asked him whether he wished to “jeopardy” his case
upon his plea of Sanctuary, and, upon consultation,
John Savage replied in the negative, saying that he
wished rather to throw himself upon the king’s mercy.
Fineux on this, said: “In this you are wise, for the
privileges of St. John’s will not aid you in the form
in which you have pleaded it. In reality it has no
greater privilege of Sanctuary than every parish church
in the kingdom; that is, it has privileges for forty days
and no more, and in this it partakes merely of the
common law of the kingdom, and has no special
privilege beyond this.”</p>

<p>Further, Fineux pointed out that even had St. John’s
possessed the Sanctuary the prior claimed, this right
did not extend to the fields, &amp;c., but in the opinion of
all the judges of the land, to which all the bishops and
clergy had assented, the bounds of any Sanctuary were
the church, cloister, and cemetery. Most certain it was
that the <i>ambitus</i> did not extend to gardens, barns, and
stables, and in his (Fineux’s) opinion, not even to the
pantry and buttery. He quotes cases in support of his
opinion. In one instance a certain William Spencer
claimed the privilege of Sanctuary when in an orchard
of the Grey Friars at Coventry. In spite of the assertion
of the guardian that the Pope had extended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
privilege to the whole enclosure, of which the place the
friars had to recreate themselves in was certainly a
portion, the plea was disallowed, and William Spencer
was hanged.</p>

<p>In regard to the privilege of the forty days, Fineux
declared that it was so obviously against the common
good and in derogation of justice, that in his opinion
it should not be suffered to continue, and he quoted
cases where it had been set aside. In several cases
where Papal privileges had been asserted, the judges
had held “quant à les Bulles du pape, le pape sans le
Roy ne ad power de fayre sanctuarie.” In other words,
Fineux rejected the plea of the murderer Savage. But
the case did not stop here, both the prior and Savage,
as we should say, “appealed,” and the matter was heard
in the presence of Cardinal Wolsey, Fineux, Brudnell,
and several members of the inner Star Chamber. Dr.
Potkyn, counsel for the Prior of St. John, pleaded the
“knowledge and allowance of the king” to prove the
privilege. No decision was arrived at, and a further
sitting of the Star Chamber was held on November 11,
1520, in the presence of the king, the cardinal, all the
judges, and divers bishops and canonists, as well as the
Prior of St. John and the Abbot of Westminster. Before
the assembly many examples of difficulties in the
past were adduced by the judges. These difficulties
they declared increased so as to endanger the peace
and law of the country, by reason of the Sanctuaries of
Westminster and St. John’s. To effect a remedy was
the chief reason of the royal presence at the meeting.
After long discussion it was declared that as St. John’s
Sanctuary was made, as it had been shown, by Papal
Bull, it was consequently void even if confirmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
king’s patent, and hence that the priory had no privilege at
all except the common one of forty days. The judges
and all the canonists were quite clear that the Pope’s right
to make a Sanctuary had never been allowed in England,
and that every such privilege must come from the
king. On the other hand, the bishops present and all
the clergy were equally satisfied that the general forty
days’ privilege belonged by right to every parish church.
The Abbot of Westminster then proved by the production
of charters and other indubitable evidence that the
Sanctuary of Westminster had its origin in the grants
of various kings, and had only been blessed by the
Pope.</p>

<p>Fineux pointed out that Sanctuary grants had
always been made to monasteries and churches “to
the laud and honour of God,” and that it was not certainly
likely to redound to God’s honour when men
could commit murder and felony, and trust to get into
the safe precinct of some Sanctuary; neither did he
believe that to have bad houses in Sanctuaries, and
such like abuses, was either to the praise of God or for
the welfare of the kingdom. Further, that as regards
Westminster, the abbot had abused his privileges as to
the <i>ambitus</i> or precincts which in law must be understood
in the restricted sense. The cardinal admitted
that there had been abuses, and a Commission was proposed
to determine the reasonable bounds. Bishop
Voysey, of Exeter, suggested that if a Sanctuary man
committed murder or felony outside, with the hope of
getting back again, the privilege of shelter should be
forfeited; but the majority were against this restriction.
On the whole, however, it was determined that for the
good of the State the uses of these Sanctuaries should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
be curtailed, and that none should be allowed in law
but such as could show a grant of the privilege from
the crown.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In the opinion of many, of whom Saint-German was
the spokesman, to go to another matter, Parliament might
assign “all the trees and grass in churchyards either to
the parson, to the vicar, or to the parish,” as it thought
fit; for although the ground was hallowed, the proceeds,
such as “trees and grass, are mere temporals, and as
such must be regulated by the power of the State.”</p>

<p>Moreover, according to the same view, whilst it would
be outside the province of the secular law to determine
the cut of a priest’s cassock or the shape of his tonsure, it
could clearly determine that no priest should wear cloth
made out of the country, or costing above a certain
price; and it might fix the amount of salary to be paid
to a chaplain or curate.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>There were circumstances, too, under which, in the
opinion of Saint-German, Parliament not only could
interfere to legislate about clerical duties, but would be
bound to do so. At the time when he was writing,
the eve of the Reformation, many things seemed to
point to this necessity for State interference. There
were signs of widespread religious differences in the
world. “Why then,” he asks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> “may not the king
and his Parliament, as well to strengthen the faith and
give health to the souls of many of his subjects, as
to save his realm being noted for heresy, seek for
the reason of the division now in the realm by diversity
of sects and opinions?… They shall have great
reward before God that set their hands to prevent the
great danger to many souls of men as well spiritual
as temporal if this division continue long. And as far
as I have heard, all the articles that are misliked (are
aimed) either against the worldly honour, worldly
power, or worldly riches of spiritual men. To express
these articles I hold it not expedient, and indeed
if what some have reported be true, many of them
be so far against the truth that no Christian man
would hold them to be true, and they that do so do
it for some other consideration.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>As an example, our author takes the question of
Purgatory, which he believes is attacked because men
want to free themselves from the money offerings
which belief in the doctrine necessitates. And indeed,
“if it were ordained by law,” he continues, “that every
curate at the death of any of their parishioners should
be bound to say publicly for their souls <i>Placebo</i>, <i>Dirige</i>
and mass, without taking anything for (the service):
and further that at a certain time, to be assigned by
Parliament, as say, once a month, or as it shall be
thought convenient, they shall do the same and pray
for the souls of their parishioners and for all Christian
souls and for the king and all the realm: and also
that religious houses do in like manner, I fancy in
a short time there would be few to say there was no
purgatory.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In some matters Saint-German considered that the
State might reasonably interfere in regard to the religious
life. The State, he thinks, would have no right
whatever to prohibit religious vows altogether; but it
would be competent for the secular authority to lay
down conditions to prevent abuses and generally protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
society where such protection was needed. “It
would be good,” for example, he writes, “to make a
law that no religious house should receive any child
below a certain age into the habit, and that he should
not be moved from the place into which he had been
received without the knowledge and assent of friends.”
This would not be to prohibit religious life, which
would not be a just law, but only the laying down
of conditions. In the fourth year of Henry IV. the
four Orders of Friars had such a law made for them;
“when the four Provincials of the said four Orders
were sworn by laying their hands upon their breasts in
open Parliament to observe the said statute.”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>In the same way the State may, Saint-German
thinks, lay down the conditions for matrimony, so long
as there was no “interference with the sacrament of
marriage.” Also, “as I suppose,” he says, “the Parliament
may well enact that every man that makes profit
of any offerings (coming) by recourse of pilgrims shall
be bound under a certain penalty not only to set up
certain tables to instruct the people how they shall
worship the saints, but also cause certain sermons to
be yearly preached there to instruct the people, so
that through ignorance they do not rather displease
than please the saints.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> “may also prohibit any miracle being
noised abroad on such slight evidence as they have
been in some places in times past; and that they shall
not be set up as miracles, under a certain penalty, nor
reported as miracles by any one till they have been
proved such in such a manner as shall be appointed
by Parliament. And it is not unlikely that many persons
grudge more at the abuse of pilgrimages than at
the pilgrimages themselves.” Parliament, he points
out, has from time to time vindicated its right to act
in matters such as these. For example: “To the
strengthening of the faith it has enacted that no man
shall presume to preach without leave of his diocesan
except certain persons exempted in the statute”
(2 Henry IV.).<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>There are, Saint-German notes, many cases where
it is by no means clear whether they are strictly belonging
to spiritual jurisdiction or not. Could the law,
for example, prohibit a bishop from ordaining any
candidate to Holy Orders who was not sufficiently
learned? Could the law which exempted priests from
serving on any inquest or jury be abrogated? These,
and such like matters in the borderland, are debatable
questions; but Saint-German makes it clear that, according
to his view, it is a mistake for clerics to claim
more exemptions from the common law than is absolutely
necessary. That there must be every protection
for their purely spiritual functions, he fully and cordially
admits; but when all this is allowed, in his opinion, it
is a grave mistake for the clergy, even from their point
of view, to try and stretch their immunities and exemptions
beyond the required limit. The less the clergy
were made a “caste,” and the more they fell in with
the nation at large, the better it would be for all parties
in the State.</p>

<p>On the question of tithe, Saint-German took the
laymen’s view. To the ecclesiastics of the period tithes
were spiritual matters, and all questions arising out of
them should be settled by archbishop or bishop in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
spiritual courts. The lawyer, on the other hand,
maintained that though given to secure spiritual services,
in themselves tithes were temporal, and therefore
should fall under the administration of the State. Who,
for example, was to determine what was payable on
new land, and to whom; say on land recovered from
the sea? In the first place, according to the lawyer,
it should be the owner of the soil who should apportion
the payment, and failing him, the Parliament, and not
the spirituality.</p>

<p>In another work<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Saint-German puts his view more
clearly. A tithe that comes irregularly, say once in
ten or twenty years, cannot be considered necessary
for the support of the clergy. That people were bound
to contribute to the just and reasonable maintenance
of those who serve the altar did not admit of doubt,
but, he holds, a question arises as to the justice of the
amount in individual cases. “Though the people be
bound by the law of reason, and also the law of God,
to find their spiritual ministers a reasonable portion of
goods to live upon, yet that they shall pay precisely the
tenth part to their spiritual ministers in the name of
that portion is but the law of man.” If the tithe did
not at any time suffice, “the people would be bound
to give more” in order to fulfil their Christian duty.
Some authority must determine, and in his opinion as
a lawyer and a layman, the only authority competent to
deal with the matter, so far as the payment of money
was concerned, was the State; and consequently Parliament
might, and at times ought, to legislate about the
payment of tithes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>In a second <i>Treatise concerning the power of the clergy
and the laws of the realm</i>, Saint-German returns to this
subject of the relation between the two jurisdictions.
This book, however, was published after Henry VIII.
had received his parliamentary title of Supreme Head
of the Church, and by that time the author’s views had
naturally become somewhat more advanced on the side
of State power. In regard to the king’s “Headship,”
he declares that in reality it is nothing new, but if
properly understood would be recognised as implied
in the kingly power, and as having nothing whatever
to do with the spiritual prerogatives as such. He has
been speaking of the writ, <i>de excommunicato capiendo</i>, by
which the State had been accustomed to seize the
person of one who had been excommunicated by the
Church for the purpose of punishment by the secular
arm, and he argues that if the Parliament were to
abrogate the law, such a change would in no sense
be a derogation of the rights of the Church. Put
briefly, the principle upon which he bases this opinion
is one which was made to apply to many other cases
besides this special one. It is this: that for a spiritual
offence no one ought in justice to be made to suffer
in the temporal order.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Whilst insisting on this, moreover,
the lawyer maintained that there were many
things which had come to be regarded as spiritual,
which were, in reality, temporal, and that it would
be better that these should be altogether transferred to
the secular arm of the State. Such, for example, were,
in his opinion, the proving and administration of wills,
the citation and consideration of cases of slander and
libel and other matters of this nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> “And there
is no doubt,” he says, “but that the Parliament may
with a cause take that power from them (<i>i.e.</i> the clergy),
and might likewise have done so before it was recognised
by the Parliament and the clergy that the king
was Head of the Church of England; for he was so
before the recognition was made, just as all other
Christian princes are in their own realms over all their
subjects, spiritual and temporal.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, as regards this, “it lieth in princes to
appease all variances and unquietness that shall arise
among the people, by whatsoever occasion it rise,
spiritual or temporal. And the king’s grace has now
no new authority in that he is confessed by the clergy
and authorised by Parliament to be the Head of the
Church of England. For it is only a declaration of his
first power committed by God to kingly and regal
authority and no new grant. Further, that, for all the
power that he has as Head of the Church, he has yet
no authority to minister any sacraments, nor to do any
other spiritual thing whereof our Lord gave power to
His apostles and disciples only.… And there is no
doubt that such power as the clergy have by the
immediate grant of Christ, neither the king nor his
Parliament can take from them, although they may
order the manner of the doing.”<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The question whether for grave offences the clergy
could be tried by the king’s judges was one which had
long raised bitter feeling on the one side and the other.
In 1512, Parliament had done something to vindicate
the power of the secular arm by passing a law practically
confining the immunity of the clergy to those in
sacred orders. It ordained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> “that all persons hereafter
committing murder or felony, &amp;c., should not be admitted
to the benefit of clergy.” This act led to a great
dispute in the next Parliament, held in 1515. The
clergy as a body resented the statute as an infringement
upon their rights and privileges, and the Abbot of
Winchcombe preached at St. Paul’s Cross to this effect,
declaring that the Lords Spiritual who had assented
to the measure had incurred ecclesiastical censures. He
argued that all clerks were in Holy Orders, and that they
were consequently not amenable to the secular tribunals.</p>

<p>The king, at the request of many of the Temporal
Lords and several of the Commons, ordered the case to
be argued at a meeting held at Blackfriars at which
the judges were present. At this debate, Dr. Henry
Standish, a Friar Minor, defended the action of Parliament,
and maintained that it was a matter of public
policy that clerks guilty of such offences should be
tried by the ordinary process of law. In reply to
the assertion that there was a decree or canon forbidding
it, and that all Christians were bound by the
canons under pain of mortal sin, Standish said: “God
forbid; for there is a decree that all bishops should
be resident at their cathedrals upon every festival day,
and yet we see the greater part of the English bishops
practise the contrary.” Moreover, he maintained that
the right of exemption of clerks from secular jurisdiction
had never been allowed in England. The bishops
were unanimously against the position of Standish,
and there can be little doubt that they had put forward
the Abbot of Winchcombe to be their spokesman at
St. Paul’s Cross. Later on, Standish was charged
before Convocation with holding tenets derogatory to
the privileges and jurisdiction of ecclesiastics. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
claimed the protection of the king, and the Temporal
Lords and judges urged the king at all costs to
maintain his right of royal jurisdiction in the matters
at issue.</p>

<p>Again a meeting of judges, certain members of
Parliament, and the king’s council, spiritual and temporal,
were assembled to deliberate on the matter at the
Blackfriars. Dr. Standish was supposed to have said
that the lesser Orders were not Holy, and that the
exemption of clerks was not <i>de jure divino</i>. These
opinions he practically admitted, saying with regard
to the first that there was a great difference between
the greater Orders and the lesser; and in regard to
the second, “that the summoning of clerks before
temporal judges implied no repugnance to the positive
law of God.” He further partially admitted saying
that “the study of canon law ought to be laid
aside, because being but ministerial to divinity it taught
people to despise that nobler science.” The judges
decided generally against the contention of the clergy,
and they, with other lords, met the king at Baynard’s
Castle to tender their advice on the matter. Here
Wolsey, kneeling before the king, declared “that he
believed none of the clergy had any intention to disoblige
the prerogative royal, that for his part he owed
all his promotion to his Highness’ favour, and therefore
would never assent to anything that should lessen
the rights of the Crown.” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> “that this business
of conventing clerks before temporal judges was, in
the opinion of the clergy, directly contrary to the
laws of God and the liberties of Holy Church, and
that both himself and the rest of the prelates were
bound by their oath to maintain this exemption. For
this reason he entreated the king, in the name of the
clergy, to refer the matter for decision to the Pope.”
Archbishop Warham added that in old times some of
the fathers of the Church had opposed the matter so
far as to suffer martyrdom in the quarrel. On the
other hand, Judge Fineux pointed out that spiritual
judges had no right by any statute to judge any clerk
for felony, and for this reason many churchmen had
admitted the competence of the secular courts for this
purpose.</p>

<p>The king finally replied on the whole case. “By
the Providence of God,” he said, “we are King of
England, in which realm our predecessors have never
owned a superior, and I would have you (the clergy)
take notice that we are resolved to maintain the rights
of our crown and temporal jurisdiction in as ample
manner as any of our progenitors.” In conclusion,
the Archbishop of Canterbury petitioned the king in
the name of the clergy for the matter to rest till such
time as they could lay the case before the See of Rome
for advice, promising that if the non-exemption of
clerks was declared not to be against the law of
God, they would willingly conform to the usage of
the country.</p>

<p>On this whole question, Saint-German maintained
that the clergy had been granted exemption from the
civil law not as a right but as a favour. There was,
in his opinion, nothing whatever in the nature of the
clerical state to justify any claim to absolute exemption,
nor was it, he contended, against the law of
God that the clergy should be tried for felony and
other crimes by civil judges. In all such things they,
like the rest of his people, were subject to their prince,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
who, because he was a Christian, did not, for that
reason, have any diminished authority over his subjects.
“Christ,” he remarks, “sent His apostles,” as
appears from the said words, “to be teachers in spiritual
matters, and not to be like princes, or to take
from princes their power.”<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Some, indeed, he says,
argue that since the coming of our Lord “Christian
princes have derived their temporal power from the
spiritual power,” established by Him in right of His
full and complete dominion over the world. But
Saint-German not only holds that such a claim has
no foundation in itself, but that all manner of texts
of Holy Scripture which are adduced in proof of the
contention are plainly twisted from their true meaning
by the spiritual authority. And many, he says, talk
as if the clergy were the Church, and the Church the
clergy, whereas they are only one portion, perhaps
the most important, and possessed of greater and special
functions; but they were not the whole, and were,
indeed, endowed with these prerogatives for the use
and benefit of the lay portion of Christ’s Church.</p>

<p>Contrary to what might have been supposed, the
difficulty between the clergy and laity about the exemption
of clerics from all lay jurisdiction did not
apparently reach any very acute stage. Sir Thomas
More says that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> “as for the conventing of priests before
secular judges, the truth is that at one time the occasion
of a sermon made the matter come to a discussion
before the king’s Highness. But neither at any time
since, nor many years before, I never heard that there
was any difficulty about it, and, moreover, that matter
ceased long before any word sprang up about this
great general division.”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>One question, theoretical indeed, but sufficiently
practical to indicate the current of thought and feeling
prevalent at the time, was as to the multiplication of
holidays on which no work was allowed to be done
by ecclesiastical law. Saint-German, in common with
other laymen of the period, maintained that the king,
or Parliament, as representing the supreme will of the
State, could refuse to allow the spiritual authority to
make new holidays. About the Sunday he is doubtful,
though he inclines to the opinion that so long as there
was one day in the week set apart for rest and prayer,
the actual day could be determined by the State. The
Sunday, he says, is partly by the law of God, partly by
the law of man. “But as for the other holidays, these
are but ceremonies, introduced by the devotion of the
people through the good example of their bishops and
priests.” And “if the multitude of the holidays is
thought hurtful to the commonwealth, and tending
rather to increase vice than virtue, or to give occasion
of pride rather than meekness, as peradventure the
synod ales and particular holidays have done in some
places, then Parliament has good authority to reform
it. But as for the holidays that are kept in honour
of Our Lady, the Apostles and other ancient Saints,
these seem right necessary and expedient.”<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>In his work, <i>Salem and Bizance</i>, which appeared in
1533 as a reply to Sir Thomas More’s <i>Apology</i>, Saint-German
takes up the same ground as in his more
strictly legal tracts. He holds that a distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
between the purely spiritual functions of the clergy
and their position as individuals in the State ought to
be allowed and recognised. The attitude of ecclesiastics
generally to such a view was, perhaps not unnaturally,
one of opposition, and where the State had
already stepped in and legislated, as for instance in the
case of “mortuaries,” their action in trying to evade
the prescription of the law, Saint-German declared
was doing much harm, in emphasising a needless conflict
between the ecclesiastical and secular jurisdiction.
“As long,” he writes, “as spiritual rulers will pretend
that their authority is so high and so immediately
derived from God that people are bound to obey them
and to accept all that they do and teach without
argument, resistance, or murmuring against them”
there will be discord and difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Christopher Saint-German’s position was not by
any means that of one who would attack the
clergy all along the line, and deprive them of
all power and influence, like so many of the
foreign sectaries of the time. He admitted, and
indeed insisted on, the fact that they had received
great and undoubted powers by their high vocation,
having their spiritual jurisdiction immediately from
God. Their temporalities, however, he maintained
they received from the secular power, and were protected
by the State in their possession. He fully
agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> “that such things as the whole clergy of
Christendom teach and order in spiritual things, and
which of long time have been by long custom and
usage in the whole body of Christendom ratified,
agreed, and confirmed, by the spirituality and temporality,
ought to be received with reverence.”<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>To this part of Saint-German’s book Sir Thomas
More takes exception in his <i>Apology</i>. The former had
said, that as long as the spiritual rulers will pretend
that their authority is so high and so immediately
derived from God that the people are bound to obey
them and accept all that they do and teach “there
would certainly be divisions and dissensions.” “If he
mean,” replies More, “that they speak thus of all
their whole authority that they may now lawfully do
and say at this time: I answer that they neither pretend,
nor never did, that all their authority is given
them immediately by God. They have authority now
to do divers things by the grant of kings and princes,
just as many temporal men also have, and by such
grants they have such rights in such things as temporal
men have in theirs.”<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Some authority and power they certainly have from
God, he says, “For the greatest and highest and most
excellent authority that they have, either God has Himself
given it to them, or else they are very presumptuous
and usurp many things far above all reason. For I
have never read, or at least I do not remember to have
read, that any king granted them the authority that now
not only prelates but other poor plain priests daily take
on them in ministering the sacraments and consecrating
the Blessed Body of Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Another popular book of the period, published by
Berthelet, just on the eve of the Reformation, is the
anonymous <i>Dialogue between a Knight and a Clerk concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the power spiritual and temporal</i>. We are not here
concerned with the author’s views as to the power of
the Popes, but only with what he states about the
attitude of men’s minds to the difficulties consequent
upon the confusion of the two jurisdictions. <i>Miles</i> (the
Knight), who, of course, took the part of the upholder
of the secular power, clearly distinguished, like
Saint-German, between directly spiritual prerogatives
and the authority and position assured to the clergy by
the State. “God forbid,” he says, “that I should deny
the right of Holy Church to know and correct men for
their sins. Not to hold this would be to deny the
sacrament of Penance and Confession altogether.”<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Moreover, like Saint-German, this author, in the person
of <i>Miles</i>, insists that the temporality “are bound to find
the spirituality that worship and serve God all that is
necessary for them. For so do all nations.”<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> But
the direction of such temporalities must, he contends,
be in the hands of the State. “What,” asks the conservative
cleric, in the person of <i>Clericus</i>, “What have
princes and kings to do with the governance of our
temporalities? Let them take their own and order
their own, and suffer us to be in peace with ours.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” replies <i>Miles</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> “the princes must in any wise
have to do therewith. I pray you, ought not men
above all things to mind the health of our souls?
Ought not we to see the wills of our forefathers fulfilled?
Falleth it not to you to pray for our forefathers
that are passed out of this life? And did not
our fathers give you our temporalities right plentifully,
to the intent that you should pray for them and spend
it all to the honour of God? And ye do nothing so;
but ye spend your temporalities in sinful deeds and
vanities, which temporalities ye should spend in works
of charity, and in alms-deeds to the poor and needy.
For to this purpose our forefathers gave ‘great and
huge dominions.’ You have received them ‘to the
intent to have clothes and food … and all overplus
besides these you ought to spend on deeds of mercy
and pity, as on poor people that are in need, and on
such as are sick and diseased and oppressed with
misery.’”<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Further, <i>Miles</i> hints that there are many at that
time who were casting hungry eyes upon the riches of
the Church, and that were it not for the protecting power
of the State, the clergy would soon find that they
were in worse plight than they think themselves to be.
And, in answer to the complaints of <i>Clericus</i> that ecclesiastics
are taxed too hardly for money to be spent on
soldiers, ships, and engines of war, he tells him that
there is no reason in the nature of things why ecclesiastical
property should not bear the burden of
national works as well as every other kind of wealth.
“I pray you hold your noise,” he exclaims somewhat
rudely;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> “stop your grudging and grumbling, and listen
patiently. Look at your many neighbours round about
you in the land, who, wanting the wherewith to support
life, gape still after your goods. If the king’s power
failed, what rest should you have? Would not the
gentlemen such as be needy, and such as have spent
their substance prodigally, when they have consumed
their own, turn to yours, and waste and destroy all
you have? Therefore, the king’s strength is to you
instead of a strong wall, and you wot well that the
king’s peace is your peace, and the king’s safeguard
is your safeguard.”<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing pages represent some of the practical
difficulties which were being experienced on the
eve of the Reformation between the ecclesiastical and
lay portion of the State in the question of jurisdiction.
Everything points to the fact that the chief difficulty
was certainly not religious. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction
in matters spiritual was cordially admitted by
all but a few fanatics. What even many churchmen
objected to, were the claims for exemption
put forward by ecclesiastics in the name of religion,
which they felt to be a stretching of spiritual prerogatives
into the domain of the temporal sovereign.
History has shown that most of these claims have in
practice been disallowed, not only without detriment
to the spiritual work of the Church, but in some instances
at least it was the frank recognition of the State
rights, which, under Providence, saved nations from
the general defection which seemed to threaten the
old ecclesiastical system. Most of the difficulties
which were, as we have seen, experienced and debated
in England were unfelt in Spain, where the sovereign
from the first made his position as to the temporalities
of the Church clearly understood by all. In Naples,
in like manner, the right of State patronage, however
objectionable to the ecclesiastical legists, was strictly
maintained. In France, the danger which at one time
threatened an overthrow of religion similar to that
which had fallen on Germany, and which at the time
was looming dark over England, was averted by the
celebrated Concordat between Leo X. and Francis I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
By this settlement of outstanding difficulties between
the two jurisdictions, all rights of election to ecclesiastical
dignities was swept away with the full and
express sanction of the Pope. The nomination of
all bishops and other dignitaries was vested in the
king, subject, of course, to Papal confirmation. All
appeals were, in the first place, to be carried in ordinary
cases to immediate superiors acting in the fixed
tribunals of the country, and then only to the Holy
See. The Papal power of appointment to benefices
was by this agreement strictly limited; and the policy
of the document was generally directed to securing
the most important ecclesiastical positions, including
even parish churches in towns, to educated men. It
is to this settlement of outstanding difficulties, the
constant causes of friction&mdash;a settlement of difficulties
which must be regarded as economic and administrative
rather than as religious&mdash;that so good a judge
as M. Hanotaux, the statesman and historian, attributes
nothing less than the maintenance of the old religion
in France. In his opinion, this Concordat did in fact
remove, to a great extent, the genuine grievances which
had long been felt by the people at large, which elsewhere
the Reformers of the sixteenth century skilfully
seized upon, as likely to afford them the most plausible
means for furthering their schemes of change in matters
strictly religious.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">ENGLAND AND THE POPE</span></h2>

<p>Nothing is more necessary for one who desires to
appreciate the true meaning of the English Reformation
than to understand the attitude of men’s minds
to the Pope and the See of Rome on the eve of the
great change. As in the event, the religious upheaval
did, in fact, lead to a national rejection of the jurisdiction
of the Roman Pontiff, it is not unnatural that
those who do not look below the surface should see
in this act the outcome and inevitable consequence
of long-continued irritation at a foreign domination.
The renunciation of Papal jurisdiction, in other words,
is taken as sufficient evidence of national hostility to
the Holy See. If this be the true explanation of the
fact, it is obvious that in the literature of the period
immediately preceding the formal renunciation of
ecclesiastical dependence on Rome, evidence more or
less abundant will be found of this feeling of dislike,
if not of detestation, for a yoke which we are told
had become unbearable.</p>

<p>At the outset, it must be confessed that any one
who will go to the literature of the period with the
expectation of collecting evidence of this kind is
doomed to disappointment. If we put on one side
the diatribes and scurrilous invectives of advanced
reformers, when the day of the doctrinal Reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
had already dawned, the inquirer in this field of knowledge
can hardly fail to be struck by the absence of
indications of any real hostility to the See of Rome in
the period in question. So far as the works of the age
are concerned: so far, too, as the acts of individuals
and even of those who were responsible agents of the
State go, the evidence of an unquestioned acceptance
of the spiritual jurisdiction of the Pope, as Head of
the Christian Church, is simply overwhelming. In
their acceptance of this supreme authority the English
were perhaps neither demonstrative nor loudly protesting,
but this in no way derogated from their loyal
and unquestioning acceptance of the supremacy of the
Holy See. History shows that up to the very eve
of the rejection of this supremacy the attitude of
Englishmen, in spite of difficulties and misunderstandings,
had been persistently one of respect for the
Pope as their spiritual head. Whilst other nations of
Christendom had been in the past centuries engaged in
endeavours by diplomacy, and even by force of
arms, to capture the Pope that they might use him
for their own national profit, England, with nothing
to gain, expecting nothing, seeking nothing, had never
entered on that line of policy, but had been content to
bow to his authority as to that of the appointed Head
of Christ’s Church on earth. Of this much there can
be no doubt. They did not reason about it, nor sift
and sort the grounds of their acceptance, any more
than a child would dream of searching into, or
philosophising upon, the obedience he freely gives to
his parents.</p>

<p>That there were at times disagreements and quarrels
may be admitted without in the least affecting the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
attitude and uninterrupted spiritual dependence of
England on the Holy See. Such disputes were
wholly the outcome of misunderstandings as to matters
in the domain rather of the temporal than of the
spiritual, or of points in the broad debatable land that
lies between the two jurisdictions. It is a failure to
understand the distinction which exists between these
that has led many writers to think that in the rejection
by Englishmen of claims put forward at various times
by the Roman curia in matters wholly temporal, or
where the temporal became involved in the spiritual,
they have a proof that England never fully acknowledged
the spiritual headship of the See of Rome.</p>

<p>That the Pope did in fact exercise great powers
in England over and above those in his spiritual prerogative
is a matter of history. No one has more
thoroughly examined this subject than Professor Maitland,
and the summary of his conclusions given in his
<i>History of English Law</i> will serve to correct many
misconceptions upon the matter. What he says may
be taken as giving a fairly accurate picture of the
relations of the Christian nations of Christendom to
the Holy See from the twelfth century to the disintegration
of the system in the throes of the Reformation.
“It was a wonderful system,” he writes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
“The whole of Western Europe was subject to the
jurisdiction of one tribunal of last resort, the Roman
curia. Appeals to it were encouraged by all manner
of means, appeals at almost every stage of almost every
proceeding. But the Pope was far more than the
president of a court of appeal. Very frequently the
courts Christian which did justice in England were
courts which were acting under his supervision and
carrying out his written instructions. A very large
part, and by far the most permanently important part,
of the ecclesiastical litigation that went on in this
country came before English prelates who were sitting
not as English prelates, not as ‘judges ordinary,’ but
as mere delegates of the Pope, commissioned to hear
and determine this or that particular case. Bracton,
indeed, treats the Pope as the ordinary judge of
every Englishman in spiritual things, and the only
ordinary judge whose powers are unlimited.”</p>

<p>The Pope enjoyed a power of declaring the law to
which but very wide and very vague limits could be set.
Each separate church might have its customs, but there
was a <i>lex communis</i>, a common law, of the universal Church.
In the view of the canonist, any special rules of the Church
of England have hardly a wider scope, hardly a less dependent
place, than have the customs of Kent or the bye-laws
of London in the eye of the English lawyer.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>We have only to examine the <i>Regesta</i> of the Popes,
even up to the dawn of difficulties in the reign of
Henry VIII., to see that the system as sketched in this
passage was in full working order; and it was herein
that chiefly lay the danger even to the spiritual prerogatives
of the Head of the Church. Had the Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of God destined that the nations of the world should
have become a Christendom in fact&mdash;a theocracy presided
over by his Vicar on earth&mdash;the system elaborated
by the Roman curia would not have tended doubtless
to obscure the real and essential prerogatives of the
spiritual Head of the Christian Church. As it was by
Providence ordained, and as subsequent events have
shown, claims of authority to determine matters more
or less of the temporal order, together with the worldly
pomp and show with which the Popes of the renaissance
had surrounded themselves, not only tended to
obscure the higher and supernatural powers which are
the enduring heritage of St. Peter’s successors in the
See of Rome; but, however clear the distinction between
the necessary and the accidental prerogatives
might appear to the mind of the trained theologian or
the perception of the saint, to the ordinary man, when
the one was called in question the other was imperilled.
And, as a fact, in England popular irritation at the
interference of the spirituality generally in matters not
wholly within the strictly ecclesiastical sphere was, at a
given moment, skilfully turned by the small reforming
party into national, if tacit, acquiescence in the rejection
of even the spiritual prerogatives of the Roman Pontiffs.</p>

<p>It is necessary to insist upon this matter if the full
meaning of the Reformation movement is to be understood.
Here in England, there can be no doubt, on
the one hand, that no nation more fully and freely
bowed to the spiritual supremacy of the Holy See; on
the other, that there was a dislike of interference in
matters which they regarded, rightly or wrongly, as
outside the sphere of the Papal prerogative. The
national feeling had grown by leaps and bounds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the early years of the sixteenth century. But it was
not until the ardent spirits among the doctrinal reformers
had succeeded in weakening the hold of Catholicity
in religion on the hearts of the people that this
rise of national feeling entered into the ecclesiastical
domain, and the love of country could be effectually
used to turn them against the Pope, even as Head of
the Christian Church. With this distinction clearly
before the mind, it is possible to understand the general
attitude of the English nation to the Pope and his
authority on the eve of the overthrow of his jurisdiction.</p>

<p>To begin with some evidence of popular teaching
as to the Pope’s position as Head of the Church. It is,
of course, evident that in many works the supremacy
of the Holy See is assumed and not positively stated.
This is exactly what we should expect in a matter
which was certainly taken for granted by all. William
Bond, a learned priest, and subsequently a monk of
Syon, with Richard Whitford, was the author of a book
called the <i>Pilgrimage of Perfection</i>, published by Wynkyn
de Worde in 1531. It is a work, as the author tells
us, “very profitable to all Christian persons to read”;
and the third book consists of a long and careful explanation
of the Creed. In the section treating about
the tenth article is to be found a very complete statement
of the teaching of the Christian religion on the
Church. After taking the marks of the Church, the
author says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> “There may be set no other foundation
for the Church, but only that which is put, namely,
Christ Jesus. It is certain, since it is founded on the
Apostles, as our Lord said to Peter, ‘I have prayed
that thy faith fail not.’ And no more it shall; for (as
St. Cyprian says) the Church of Rome was never yet
the root of heresy. This Church Apostolic is so named
the Church of Rome, because St. Peter and St. Paul,
who under Christ were heads and princes of this
Church, deposited there the tabernacles of their bodies,
which God willed should be buried there and rest in
Rome, and that should be the chief see in the world;
just as commonly in all other places the chief see of
the bishop is where the chief saint and bishop of the
see is buried. By this you may know how Christ is the
Head of the Church, and how our Holy Father the Pope
of Rome is Head of the Church. Many, because they
know not this mystery of Holy Scripture, have erred
and fallen to heresies in denying the excellent dignity
of our Holy Father the Pope of Rome.”<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>In the same way Roger Edgworth, a preacher in
the reign of Henry VIII., speaking on the text “<i>Tu
vocaberis Cephas</i>,” says: “And by this the error and
ignorance of certain summalists are confounded, who
take this text as one of their strongest reasons for the
supremacy of the Pope of Rome. In so doing, such
summalists would plainly destroy the text of St. John’s
Gospel to serve their purpose, which they have no
need to do, for there are as well texts of Holy Scripture
and passages of ancient writers which abundantly prove
the said primacy of the Pope.”<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>When by 1523 the attacks of Luther and his
followers on the position of the Pope had turned
men’s minds in England to the question, and caused
them to examine into the grounds of their belief, several
books on the subject appeared in England. One in
particular, intended to be subsidiary to the volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
published by the king himself against Luther, was
written by a theologian named Edward Powell, and
published by Pynson in London. In his preface,
Powell says that before printing his work he had
submitted it to the most learned authority at Oxford
(<i>eruditissimo Oxoniensium</i>). The first part of the book
is devoted to a scientific treatise upon the Pope’s
supremacy, with all the proofs from Scripture and the
Fathers set out in detail. “This then,” he concludes,
“is the Catholic Church, which, having the Roman
Pontiff, the successor of Peter, as its head, offers the
means of sanctifying the souls of all its members, and
testifies to the truth of all that is to be taught.” The
high priesthood of Peter “is said to be Roman, not
because it cannot be elsewhere, but through a certain
congruity which makes Rome the most fitting place.
That is, that where the centre of the world’s government
was, there also should be placed the high priesthood of
Christ. Just as of old the summus Pontifex was in
Jerusalem, the metropolis of the Jewish nation, so now
it is in Rome, the centre of Christian civilisation.”<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>We naturally, of course, turn to the works of
Sir Thomas More for evidence of the teaching as to
the Pope’s position at this period; and his testimony
is abundant and definite. Thus in the second book
of his <i>Dyalogue</i>, written in 1528, arguing that there
must be unity in the Church of Christ, he points out
that the effect of Lutheranism has been to breed diversity
of faith and practice. “Though they began so
late,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> “yet there are not only as many sects
almost as men, but also the masters themselves change
their minds and their opinions every day. Bohemia
is also in the same case: one faith in the town, another
in the field; one in Prague, another in the next town;
and yet in Prague itself, one faith in one street, another
in the next. And yet all these acknowledge that they
cannot have the Sacraments ministered but by such
priests as are made by authority derived and conveyed
from the Pope who is, under Christ, Vicar and head of
our Church.”<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It is important to note in this passage
how the author takes for granted the Pope’s supreme
authority over the Christian Church. To this subject
he returns, and is more explicit in a later chapter of
the same book. The Church, he says, is the “company
and congregation of all nations professing the
name of Christ.” This church “has begun with Christ,
and has had Him for its head and St. Peter His Vicar
after Him, and the head under Him; and always since,
the successors of him continually. And it has had His
holy faith and His blessed Sacraments and His holy
Scriptures delivered, kept, and conserved therein by
God and His Holy Spirit, and albeit some nations fall
away, yet just as no matter how many boughs whatever
fall from the tree, even though more fall than
be left thereon, still there is no doubt which is the
very tree, although each of them were planted again in
another place and grew to a greater than the stock it
first came off, in the same way we see and know well
that all the companies and sects of heretics and schismatics,
however great they grow, come out of this Church
I speak of; and we know that the heretics are they
that are severed, and the Church the stock that they all
come out of.”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Here Sir Thomas More expressly gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
communion with the successors of St. Peter as one
of the chief tests of the true Church.</p>

<p>Again, in his <i>Confutation of Tyndale’s Answer</i>, written
in 1532 when he was Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas
More speaks specially about the absolute necessity of
the Church being One and not able to teach error.
There is one known and recognised Church existing
throughout the world, which “is that mystical body be
it never so sick.” Of this mystical body “Christ is the
principal head”; and it is no part of his concern, he
says, for the moment to determine “whether the successor
of St. Peter is his vicar-general and head under
him, as all Christian nations have now long taken him.”<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Later on he classes himself with “poor popish men,”<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
and in the fifth book he discusses the question “whether
the Pope and his sect” (as Tyndale called them) “is
Christ’s Church or no.” On this matter More is perfectly
clear. “I call the Church of Christ,” he says,
“the known Catholic Church of all Christian nations,
neither gone out nor cut off. And although all these
nations do now and have long since recognised and
acknowledged the Pope, not as the bishop of Rome
but as the successor of St. Peter, to be their chief
spiritual governor under God and Christ’s Vicar on
earth, yet I never put the Pope as part of the definition
of the Church, by defining it to be the common
known congregation of all Christian nations under one
head the Pope.”</p>

<p>I avoided this definition purposely, he continues,
so as not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> “to entangle the matter with the two questions
at once, for I knew well that the Church being
proved this common known Catholic congregation of
all Christian nations abiding together in one faith,
neither fallen nor cut off; there might, peradventure,
be made a second question after that, whether over
all this Catholic Church the Pope must needs be head
and chief governor and chief spiritual shepherd, or
whether, if the unity of the faith was kept among
them all, every province might have its own spiritual
chief over itself, without any recourse unto the
Pope.…</p>

<p>“For the avoiding of all such intricacies, I purposely
abstained from putting the Pope as part of
the definition of the Church, as a thing that was not
necessary; for if he be the necessary head, he is included
in the name of the whole body, and whether
he be or not is a matter to be treated and disputed
of besides” (p. 615). As to Tyndale’s railing against
the authority of the Pope because there have been
“Popes that have evil played their parts,” he should
remember, says More, that “there have been Popes
again right holy men, saints and martyrs too,” and
that, moreover, the personal question of goodness or
badness has nothing to say to the office.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>In like manner, More, when arguing against Friar
Barnes, says that like the Donatists “these heretics
call the Catholic Christian people papists,” and in this
they are right, since “Saint Austin called the successor
of Saint Peter the chief head on earth of the whole
Catholic Church, as well as any man does now.” He
here plainly states his view of the supremacy of the See
of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> He accepted it not only as an antiquarian
fact, but as a thing necessary for the preservation of the
unity of the Faith. Into the further question whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the office of supreme pastor was established by Christ
Himself, or, as theologians would say, <i>de jure divino</i>,
or whether it had grown with the growth and needs
of the Church, More did not then enter. The fact was
sufficient for him that the only Christian Church he
recognised had for long ages regarded the Pope as
the <i>Pastor pastorum</i>, the supreme spiritual head of the
Church of Christ. His own words, almost at the end
of his life, are the best indication of his mature conclusion
on this matter. “I have,” he says, “by the
grace of God, been always a Catholic, never out of
communion with the Roman Pontiff; but I have heard
it said at times that the authority of the Roman Pontiff
was certainly lawful and to be respected, but still an
authority derived from human law, and not standing upon
a divine prescription. Then, when I observed that public
affairs were so ordered that the sources of the power
of the Roman Pontiff would necessarily be examined, I
gave myself up to a diligent examination of that question
for the space of seven years, and found that the authority
of the Roman Pontiff, which you rashly&mdash;I will
not use stronger language&mdash;have set aside, is not only
lawful to be respected and necessary, but also grounded
on the divine law and prescription. That is my opinion,
that is the belief in which, by the grace of God, I shall
die.”<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Looking at More’s position in regard to this question
in the light of all that he has written, it would
seem to be certain that he never for a moment doubted
that the Papacy was necessary for the Church. He
accepted this without regard to the reasons of the faith
that was in him, and in this he was not different from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the body of Englishmen at large. When, in 1522,
the book by Henry VIII. appeared against Luther,
it drew the attention of Sir Thomas specially to a
consideration of the grounds upon which the supremacy
of the Pope was held by Catholics. As the result
of his examination he became so convinced that it was
of divine institution that “my conscience would be
in right great peril,” he says, “if I should follow the
other side and deny the primacy to be provided of
God.” Even before examination More evidently held
implicitly the same ideas, since in his Latin book against
Luther, published in 1523, he declared his entire
agreement with Bishop Fisher on the subject. That
the latter was fully acquainted with the reasons which
went to prove that the Papacy was of divine institution,
and that he fully accepted it as such, is certain.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>When, with the failure of the divorce proceedings,
came the rejection of Papal supremacy in England,
there were plenty of people ready to take the winning
side, urging that the rejection was just, and not contrary
to the true conception of the Christian Church.
It is interesting to note that in all the pulpit tirades
against the Pope and what was called his “usurped
supremacy,” there is no suggestion that this supremacy
had not hitherto been fully and freely recognised by
all in the country. On the contrary, the change was
regarded as a happy emancipation from an authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
which had been hitherto submitted to without question
or doubt. A sermon preached at St. Paul’s the
Sunday after the execution of the Venerable Bishop
Fisher, and a few days before Sir Thomas More was
called to lay down his life for the same cause, is of
interest, as specially making mention of these two
great men, and of the reasons which had forced them
to lay down their lives in the Pope’s quarrel. The
preacher was one Simon Matthew, and his object was
to instruct the people in the new theory of the Christian
Church necessary on the rejection of the headship of
the Pope. “The diversity of regions and countries,”
he says, “does not make any diversity of churches,
but a unity of faith makes all regions one Church.”
“There was,” he continued, “no necessity to know
Peter, as many have reckoned, in the Bishop of Rome,
(teaching) that except we knew him and his holy
college, we could not be of Christ’s Church. Many
have thought it necessary that if a man would be a
member of the Church of Christ, he must belong to
the holy church of Rome and take the Holy Father
thereof for the supreme Head and for the Vicar of
Christ, yea for Christ Himself, (since) to be divided
from him was even to be divided from Christ.” This,
the preacher informs his audience, is “damnable teaching,”
and that “the Bishop of Rome has no more
power by the laws of God in this realm than any foreign
bishop.”</p>

<p>He then goes on to speak of what was, no doubt,
in everybody’s mind at the time, the condemnation of
the two eminent Englishmen for upholding the ancient
teachings as to the Pope’s spiritual headship. “Of
late,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> “you have had experience of some,
whom neither friends nor kinsfolk, nor the judgment
of both universities, Cambridge and Oxford, nor the
universal consent of all the clergy of this realm, nor
the laws of the Parliament, nor their most natural and
loving prince, could by any gentle ways revoke from
their disobedience, but would needs persist therein,
giving pernicious occasion to the multitude to murmur
and grudge at the king’s laws, seeing that they were
men of estimation and would be seen wiser than all
the realm and of better conscience than others, justifying
themselves and condemning all the realm besides.
These being condemned and the king’s prisoners, yet
did not cease to conceive ill of our sovereign, refusing
his laws, but even in prison wrote to their mutual
comfort in their damnable opinions. I mean Doctor
Fisher and Sir Thomas More, whom I am as sorry to
name as any man here is to hear named: sorry for
that they, being sometime men of worship and honour,
men of famous learning and many excellent graces
and so tenderly sometime beloved by their prince,
should thus unkindly, unnaturally, and traitorously use
themselves. Our Lord give them grace to be repentant!
Let neither their fame, learning, nor honour
move you loving subjects from your prince; but regard
ye the truth.”</p>

<p>The preacher then goes on to condemn the coarse
style of preaching against the Pope in which some
indulged at that time. “I would exhort,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
“such as are of my sort and use preaching, so to
temper their words that they be not noted to speak of
stomach and rather to prate than preach. Nor would
I have the defenders of the king’s matters rage and rail,
or scold, as many are thought to do, calling the Bishop
of Rome the ‘harlot of Babylon’ or ‘the beast of
Rome,’ with many such other, as I have heard some
say; these be meeter to preach at Paul’s Wharf than
at Paul’s Cross.”<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The care that was taken at this time in sermons to
the people to decry the Pope’s authority, as well as the
abuse which was hurled at his office, is in reality
ample proof of the popular belief in his supremacy,
which it was necessary to eradicate from the hearts
of the English people. Few, probably, would have
been able to state the reason for their belief; but that
the spiritual headship was fully and generally accepted
as a fact is, in view of the works of the period, not open
to question. Had there been disbelief, or even doubt,
as to the matter, some evidence of this would be forthcoming
in the years that preceded the final overthrow
of Papal jurisdiction in England.</p>

<p>Nor are direct declarations of the faith of the
English Church wanting. To the evidence already
adduced, a sermon preached by Bishop Longland in
1527, before the archbishops and bishops of England
in synod at Westminster, may be added. The discourse
is directed against the errors of Luther and
the social evils to which his teaching had led in Germany.
The English bishops, Bishop Longland declares,
are determined to do all in their power to
preserve the English Church from this evil teaching,
and he exhorts all to pray that God will not allow
the universal and chief Church&mdash;the Roman Church&mdash;to
be further afflicted, that He will restore liberty
to the most Holy Father and high-priest now impiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
imprisoned, and in a lamentable state; that He Himself
will protect the Church’s freedom threatened by a
multitude of evil men, and through the pious prayers
of His people will free it and restore its most Holy
Father. Just as the early Christians prayed when Peter
was in prison, so ought all to pray in these days of
affliction. “Shall we not,” he cries, “mourn for the
evil life of the chief Church (of Christendom)? Shall
we not beseech God for the liberation of the primate
and chief ruler of the Church? Let us pray then; let
us pray that through our prayers we may be heard.
Let us implore freedom for our mother, the Catholic
Church, and the liberty, so necessary for the Christian
religion, of our chief Father on earth&mdash;the Pope.”<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Again, Dr. John Clark, the English ambassador in
Rome, when presenting Henry’s book against Luther to
Leo X. in public consistory, said that the English king
had taken up the defence of the Church because in
attacking the Pope the German reformer had tried to
subvert the order established by God Himself. In
the <i>Babylonian Captivity of the Church</i> he had given
to the world a book “most pernicious to mankind,”
and before presenting Henry’s reply, he begged to be
allowed to protest “the devotion and veneration of
the king towards the Pope and his most Holy See.”
Luther had declared war “not only against your
Holiness but also against your office; against the ecclesiastical
hierarchy, against this See, and against that
Rock established by God Himself.” England, the
speaker continued, “has never been behind other
nations in the worship of God and the Christian faith,
and in obedience to the Roman Church.” Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
“no nation” detests more cordially “this monster
(Luther) and the heresies broached by him.” For he
has declared war “not only against your Holiness but
against your office; against the ecclesiastical hierarchy,
against this See, that Rock established by God Himself.”<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the evidence goes to show the full acceptance
by the English people of the Pope’s spiritual
headship of the Church, it is also true that the system
elaborated by the ecclesiastical lawyers in the later
Middle Ages, dealing, as it did, so largely with temporal
matters, property, and the rights attaching thereto,
opened the door to causes of disagreement between
Rome and England, and at times open complaints and
criticism of the exercise of Roman authority in England
made themselves heard. This is true of all periods of
English history. Since these disagreements are obviously
altogether connected with the question, not of
spirituals, but of temporals, they would not require any
more special notice but for the misunderstandings they
have given rise to in regard to the general attitude of
men’s minds to Rome and Papal authority on the eve
of the Reformation. It is easy to find evidence of this.
As early as 1517, a work bearing on this question appeared
in England. It was a translation of several
tracts that had been published abroad on the debated
matter of Constantine’s donation to the Pope,
and it was issued from the press of Thomas Godfray
in a well-printed folio. After a translation of the
Latin version of a Greek manuscript of Constantine’s
gift, which had been found in the Papal library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by Bartolomeo Pincern, and published by order of
Pope Julius II., there is given in this volume the
critical examination of this gift by Laurence Valla,
the opinion of Nicholas of Cusa, written for the Council
of Basle, and that of St. Antoninus, Archbishop of
Florence. The interest of the volume for the present
purpose chiefly consists in the fact of the publication
in England at this date of the views expressed
by Laurence Valla. Valla had been a canon of the
Lateran and an eminent scholar, who was employed
by Pope Nicholas V. to translate Thucydides and
Herodotus. His outspoken words got him into difficulties
with the Roman curia, and obliged him to
retire to Naples, where he died in 1457. The tract
was edited with a preface by the leader of the reform
party in Germany, Ulrich von Hutten. In this introduction
von Hutten says that by the publication of
Pincern’s translation of the supposed donation of
Constantine Julius II. had “provoked and stirred up
men to war and battle,” and further, he blames the
Pontiff because he would not permit Valla’s work
against the genuineness of the gift to be published.
With the accession of Leo X. von Hutten looked,
he declares, for better days, since “by striking as it
were a cymbal of peace the Pope has raised up the
hearts and minds of all Christian people.” Before
this time the truth could not be spoken. Popes
looked “to pluck the riches and goods of all men
to their own selves,” with the result that “on the
other side they take away from themselves all that
belongs to the succession of St. Peter.”</p>

<p>Valla, of course, condemns the supposed donation
of Constantine to the Pope as spurious, and declares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
against the temporal claims the See of Rome had
founded upon it. He strongly objects to the “temporal
as well as the spiritual sword” being in the hands
of the successors of St. Peter. “They say,” he writes,
“that the city of Rome is theirs, that the kingdom of
Naples is their own property: that all Italy, France, and
Spain, Germany, England, and all the west part of the
world belongs to them. For all these nations and
countries (they say) are contained in the instrument
and writ of the donation or grant.”</p>

<p>The whole tract is an attack upon the temporal
sovereignty of the head of the Christian Church, and it
was indeed a bold thing for Ulrich von Hutten to publish
it and dedicate it to Pope Leo X. For the present
purpose it is chiefly important to find all this set out in
an English dress, whilst so far and for a long while
after, the English people were loyal and true to the
spiritual headship of the Pope, and were second to no
other nation in their attachment to him. At that time
recent events, including the wars of Julius II., must
certainly have caused men to reflect upon the temporal
aspect of the Papacy; and hearts more loyal to the
successor of St. Peter than was that of Von Hutten
would probably have joined fervently in the concluding
words of his preface as it appeared in English.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
“Would to God I might (for there is nothing I do long
for more) once see it brought to pass that the Pope
were only the Vicar of Christ and not also the Vicar of
the Emperor, and that this horrible saying may no
longer be heard: ‘the Church fighteth and warreth
against the Perugians, the Church fighteth against the
people of Bologna.’ It is not the Church that fights
and wars against Christian men; it is the Pope that
does so. The Church fights against wicked spirits in
the regions of the air. Then shall the Pope be called,
and in very deed be, a Holy Father, the Father of all
men, the Father of the Church. Then shall he not
raise and stir up wars and battles among Christian men,
but he shall allay and stop the wars which have been
stirred up by others, by his apostolic censure and papal
majesty.”<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Evidence of what, above, has been called the probable
searching of men’s minds as to the action of
the Popes in temporal matters, may be seen in a book
called a <i>Dyalogue between a knight and a clerk, concerning
the power spiritual and temporal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> In reply to the complaint
of the clerk that in the evil days in which their
lot had fallen “the statutes and ordinances of bishops
of Rome and the decrees of holy fathers” were disregarded,
the knight exposes a layman’s view of the
matter. “Whether they ordain,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> “or have
ordained in times past of the temporality, may well be
law to you, but not to us. No man has power to
ordain statutes of things over which he has no lordship,
as the king of France may ordain no statute (binding)
on the emperor nor the emperor on the king of England.
And just as princes of this world may ordain no statutes
for your spirituality over which they have no power;
no more may you ordain statutes of their temporalities
over which you have neither power nor authority.
Therefore, whatever you ordain about temporal things,
over which you have received no power from God, is
vain (and void). And therefore but lately, I laughed
well fast, when I heard that Boniface VIII. had made
a new statute that he himself should be above all
secular lords, princes, kings, and emperors, and above
all kingdoms, and make laws about all things: and that
he only needed to write, for all things shall be his when
he has so written: and thus all things will be yours.
If he wishes to have my castle, my town, my field,
my money, or any other such thing he needed, nothing
but to will it, and write it, and make a decree, and
wot that it be done, (for) to all such things he has a
right.”</p>

<p>The clerk does not, however, at once give up the
position. You mean, he says in substance, that in
your opinion the Pope has no power over your property
and goods. “Though we should prove this by
our law and by written decrees, you account them for
nought. For you hold that Peter had no lordship or
power over temporals, but by such law written. But
if you will be a true Christian man and of right belief,
you will not deny that Christ is the lord of all things.
To Him it is said in the Psalter book: ‘Ask of me, and
I will give you nations for thine heritage, and all the
world about for thy possession’ (Ps. ii.). These are
God’s words, and no one doubts that He can ordain for
the whole earth.”</p>

<p>Nobody denies God’s lordship over the earth,
replied the knight, “but if be proved by Holy Writ
that the Pope is lord of all temporalities, then kings
and princes must needs be subject to the Pope in
temporals as in spirituals.” So they are, in effect,
answered the clerk. Peter was made “Christ’s full
Vicar,” and as such he can do what his lord can,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
“especially when he is Vicar with full power, without
any withdrawing of power, and he thus can direct all
Christian nations in temporal matters.” But, said the
knight, “Christ’s life plainly shows that He made no
claim whatever to temporal power. Also in Peter’s
commission He gave him not the keys of the kingdom
of the earth, but the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
It is also evident that the bishops of the Hebrews were
subjects of the kings, and kings deposed bishops; but,”
he adds, fearing to go too far, “God forbid that they
should do so now.” Then he goes on to quote St. Paul
in the Epistle to the Hebrews to prove that St. Peter
was Christ’s Vicar only in “the godly kingdom of
souls, and that though some temporal things may be
managed by bishops, yet nevertheless it is plain and
evident that bishops should not be occupied in the
government of the might and lordship of the world.”
And indeed, he urges, “Christ neither made St. Peter a
knight nor a crowned king, but ordained him a priest
and bishop.” If the contention that “the Pope is the
Vicar of God in temporal matter be correct,” then of
necessity you must also grant that “the Pope may take
from you and from us all the goods that you and we
have, and give them all to whichever of his nephews or
cousins he wills and give no reason why: and also that
he may take away from princes and kings principalities
and kingdoms, at his own will, and give them where he
likes.”<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>This statement by the layman of the advanced
clerical view is somewhat bald, and is probably intentionally
exaggerated; but that it could be published
even as a caricature of the position taken up by some
ecclesiastics, shows that at this time some went very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
far indeed in their claims. It is all the more remarkable
that the argument is seriously put forward in
a tract, the author of which is evidently a Catholic
at heart, and one who fully admits the supreme jurisdiction
of the Pope in all matters spiritual. Of course,
when the rejection of Papal jurisdiction became imminent,
there were found many who by sermons and
books endeavoured to eradicate the old teaching from
the people’s hearts, and then it was that what was called,
“the pretensions” of the successors of St. Peter in
matters temporal were held up to serve as a convenient
means of striking at the spiritual prerogatives. As a
sample, a small book named a <i>Mustre of scismatyke
bysshops of Rome</i> may be taken. It was printed in
1534, and its title is sufficient to indicate its tone.
The author, one John Roberts, rakes together a good
many unsavoury tales about the lives of individual
Popes, and in particular he translates the life of
Gregory VII. to enforce his moral. In his preface
he says, “There is a fond, foolish, fantasy raging in
many men’s heads nowadays, and it is this: the
Popes, say they, cannot err. This fantastical blindness
was never taught by any man of literature, but
by some peckish pedler or clouting collier: it is so
gross in itself.” And I “warn, advise, beseech, and
adjure all my well-beloved countrymen in England
that men do not permit themselves to be blinded with
affection, with hypocrisy, or with superstition. What
have we got from Rome but pulling, polling, picking,
robbing, stealing, oppression, blood-shedding, and
tyranny daily exercised upon us by him and his.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Again, as another example of how the mind of the
people was stirred up, we may take a few sentences
from <i>A Worke entytled of the olde God and the new</i>. This
tract is one of the most scurrilous of the German productions
of the period. It was published in English
by Myles Coverdale, and is on the list of books prohibited
by the king in 1534. After a tirade against
the Pope, whom he delights in calling “anti-Christ,”
the author declares that the Popes are the cause of
many of the evils from which people were suffering
at that time. In old days, he says, the Bishop of
Rome was nothing more “than a pastor or herdsman,”
and adds: “Now he who has been at Rome
in the time of Pope Alexander VI. or of Pope Julius II.,
he need not read many histories. I put it to his judgment
whether any of the Pagans or of the Turks ever
did lead such a life as did these.”<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The same temper of mind appears in the preface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of a book called <i>The Defence of Peace</i>, translated into
English by William Marshall and printed in 1535.
The work itself was written by Marsilius of Padua
about 1323, but the preface is dated 1522. The
whole tone is distinctly anti-clerical, but the main
line of attack is developed from the side of the temporalities
possessed by churchmen. Even churchmen,
he says, look mainly to the increase of their worldly
goods. “Riches give honour, riches give benefices,
riches give power and authority, riches cause men to
be regarded and greatly esteemed.” Especially is the
author of the preface severe upon the temporal
position which the Pope claims as inalienably united
with his office as head of the Church. Benedict
XII., he says, acted in many places as if he were
all powerful, appointing rulers and officers in cities
within the emperor’s dominions, saying, “that all
power and rule and empire was his own, for as much
as whosoever is the successor of Peter on earth is
the only Vicar or deputy of Jesus Christ the King of
Heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>In the body of the book itself the same views are
expressed. The authority of the primacy is said to
be “not immediately from God, but by the will and
mind of man, just as other offices of a commonwealth
are,” and that the real meaning and extent of the
claims put forward by the Pope can be seen easily.
They are temporal, not spiritual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> “This is the meaning
of this title among the Bishops of Rome, that
as Christ had the fulness of power and jurisdiction
over all kings, princes, commonwealth, companies, or
fellowships, and all singular persons, so in like manner
they who call themselves the Vicars of Christ and
Peter, have also the same fulness of enactive jurisdiction,
determined by no law of man,” and thus
it is that “the Bishops of Rome, with their desire
for dominion, have been the cause of discords and
wars.”<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Lancelot Ridley, in his <i>Exposition of the Epistle of
Jude</i>, published in 1538 after the breach with Rome,
takes the same line. The Pope has no right to have
“exempted himself” and “other spiritual men from
the obedience to the civil rulers and powers.” Some,
indeed, he says, “set up the usurped power of the
Bishop of Rome above kings, princes, and emperors,
and that by the ordinance of God, as if God and His
Holy Scripture did give to the Bishop of Rome a
secular power above kings, princes, and emperors here
in this world. It is evident by Scripture that the
Bishop of Rome has no other power but at the pleasure
of princes, than in the ministration of the Word of
God in preaching God’s Word purely and sincerely,
to reprove by it evil men, and to do such things as
become a preacher, a bishop, a minister of God’s
Word to do. Other power Scripture does not attribute
to the Bishop of Rome, nor suffer him to use. Scripture
wills him to be a bishop, and to do the office of
a bishop, and not to play the prince, the king, the
emperor, the lord, and so forth.”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It is important
to note in this passage that the writer was a reformer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and that he was expressing his views after the jurisdiction
of the Holy See had been rejected by the king
and his advisers. The ground of the rejection, according
to him&mdash;or at any rate the reason which it was
desired to emphasise before the public&mdash;would appear
to be the temporal authority which the Popes had
been exercising.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1538, Richard Morysine published
a translation of a letter addressed by John
Sturmius, the Lutheran, to the cardinals appointed by
Pope Paul III. to consider what could be done to
stem the evils which threatened the Church. As the
work of this Papal commission was then directly
put before the English people, some account of it is
almost necessary. The commission consisted of four
cardinals, two archbishops, one bishop, the abbot of
San Giorgio, Venice, and the master of the Sacred
Palace, and its report was supposed to have been
drafted by Cardinal Caraffa, afterwards Pope Paul IV.
The document thanks God who has inspired the Pope
“to put forth his hand to support the ruins of the
tottering and almost fallen Church of Christ, and to
raise it again to its pristine height.” As a beginning,
the Holy Father has commanded them to lay bare to
him “those most grave abuses, that is diseases, by
which the Church of God, and this Roman curia
especially, is afflicted,” and which has brought about
the state of ruin now so evident. The initial cause
of all has been, they declare, that the Popes have
surrounded themselves with people who only told them
what they thought would be pleasant to them, and who
had not the honesty and loyalty to speak the truth.
This adulation had deceived the Roman Pontiffs about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
many things. “To get the truth to their ears was
always most difficult. Teachers sprung up who were
ready to declare that the Pope was the master of all
benefices, and as master might by right sell them as
his own.” As a consequence, it was taught that the
Pope could not be guilty of simony, and that the will
of the Pope was the highest law, and could override
all law. “From this source, Holy Father,” they continue,
“as from the Trojan horse, so many abuses
and most grievous diseases have grown up in the
Church of God.” Even pagans, they say, scoff at
the state of the Christian Church as it is at present,
and they, the commissioners, beg the Pope not to
delay in immediately taking in hand the correction
of the manifest abuses which afflict and disgrace
the Church of Christ. “Begin the cure,” they
say, “whence sprung the disease. Follow the teaching
of the Apostle St. Paul: ‘be a dispenser, not a
lord.’”</p>

<p>They then proceed to note the abuses which to
them are most apparent, and to suggest remedies.
We are not concerned with these further than to
point out that, as a preliminary, they state that the
true principle of government is, that what is the law
must be kept, and that dispensations should be granted
only on the most urgent causes, since nothing brings
government to such bad repute as the continual exercise
of the power of dispensation. Further, they note
that it is certainly not lawful for the Vicar of Christ
to make any profit (<i>lucrum</i>) by the dispensations he
is obliged to give.</p>

<p>Sturmius, in his preface, says he had hopes of better
things, now that there was a Pope ready to listen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
“It is a rare thing, and much more than man could
hope for, that there should come a Bishop of Rome
who would require his prelates upon their oath to open
the truth, to show abuses, and to seek remedies for
them.” He is pleased to think that these four cardinals,
Sadolet, Paul Caraffa, Contarini, and Reginald Pole had
allowed fully and frankly that a great portion of the
difficulty had come from the unfortunate attitude of the
Popes in regard to worldly affairs. “You acknowledge,”
he says, “that no lordship is committed to the Bishop
of Rome, but rather a certain cure by which he may
rule things in the church according to good order. If
you admit this to be true and will entirely grant us this,
a great part of our (<i>i.e.</i> Lutheran) controversy is taken
away; granting this also, that we did not dissent from
you without great and just causes.” The three points
the cardinals claimed for the Pope, it may be noted,
were: (1) that he was to be Bishop of Rome; (2) that
he was to be universal Bishop; and (3) that he should
be allowed temporal sovereignty over certain cities in
Italy.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Again we find the same view put before the
English people in this translation: the chief objection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to the admission of Papal prerogatives was the “lordship”
which he claimed over and above the spiritual
powers he exercised as successor of St. Peter. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
this point we find preachers and writers of the period
insisting most clearly and definitely. Some, of course,
attack the spiritual jurisdiction directly, but most
commonly such attacks are flavoured and served up
for general consumption by a supply of abuse of the
temporal assumptions and the worldly show of the
Popes. This appealed to the popular mind, and to
the growing sense of national aims and objects, and
the real issue of the spiritual headship was obscured
by the plea of national sentiment and safeguards.</p>

<p>To take one more example: Bishop Tunstall, on
Palm Sunday, 1539, preached before the king and
court. His object was to defend the rejection of the
Papal supremacy and jurisdiction. He declaimed
against the notion that the Popes were to be considered
as free from subjection to worldly powers,
maintaining that in this they were like all other men.
“The Popes,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> “exalt their seat above the
stars of God, and ascend above the clouds, and will
be like to God Almighty.… The Bishop of Rome
offers his feet to be kissed, shod with his shoes on.
This I saw myself, being present thirty-four years ago,
when Julius, the Bishop of Rome, stood on his feet
and one of his chamberlains held up his skirt because
it stood not, as he thought, with his dignity that he
should do it himself, that his shoes might appear,
whilst a nobleman of great age prostrated himself upon
the ground and kissed his shoes.”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>To us, to-day, much that was written and spoken
at this time will appear, like many of the above passages,
foolish and exaggerated; but the language served its
purpose, and contributed more than anything else to
lower the Popes in the eyes of the people, and to
justify in their minds the overthrow of the ecclesiastical
system which had postulated the Pope as the universal
Father of the Christian Church. Each Sunday, in
every parish church throughout the country, they had
been invited in the bidding prayer, as their fathers had
been for generations, to remember their duty of praying
for their common Father, the Pope. When the
Pope’s authority was finally rejected by the English
king and his advisers, it was necessary to justify this
serious breach with the past religious practice, and the
works of the period prove beyond doubt that this was
done in the popular mind by turning men’s thoughts
to the temporal aspect of the Papacy, and making them
think that it was for the national profit and honour that
this foreign yoke should be cast off. Whilst this is
clear, it is also equally clear in the works of the time
that the purely religious aspect of the question was as
far as possible relegated to a secondary place in the
discussions. This was perhaps not unnatural, as the
duty of defending the rejection of the Papal supremacy
can hardly have been very tasteful to those who were
forced by the strong arm of the State to justify it before
the people. As late as 1540 we are told by a contemporary
writer that the spirituality under the bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
“favour as much as they dare the Bishop of Rome’s
laws and his ways.”<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Even the actual meaning attached to the formal
acknowledgment of the king’s Headship by the clergy
was sufficiently ambiguous to be understood, by some
at least, as aimed merely at the temporal jurisdiction
of the Roman curia. It is true it is usually understood
that Convocation by its act, acknowledging
Henry as sole supreme Head of the Church of
England, gave him absolute spiritual jurisdiction.
Whatever may have been the intention of the king
in requiring the acknowledgment from the clergy, it
seems absolutely certain that the ruling powers in the
Church considered that by their grant there was no
derogation of the Pope’s spiritual jurisdiction.</p>

<p>A comparison of the clauses required by Henry
with those actually granted by Convocation makes it
evident that any admission that the crown had any
cure of souls, that is, spiritual jurisdiction, was specifically
guarded against. In place of the clause containing
the words, “cure of souls committed to his Majesty,”
proposed in the king’s name to his clergy, they adopted
the form, “the nation committed to his Majesty.” The
other royal demands were modified in the same manner,
and it is consequently obvious that all the insertions
proposed by the crown were weighed with the greatest
care by skilled ecclesiastical jurists in some two and
thirty sessions, and the changes introduced by them
with the proposals made on behalf of the king throw
considerable light upon the meaning which Convocation
intended to give to the <i>Supremum Caput</i> clause. In one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sense, perhaps not the obvious one, but one that had
<i>de facto</i> been recognised during Catholic ages, the sovereign
was the Protector&mdash;the <i>advocatus</i>&mdash;of the Church
in his country, and to him the clergy would look to
protect his people from the introduction of heresy and
for maintenance in their temporalities. So that whilst,
on the one hand, the king and Thomas Cromwell
may well have desired the admission of Henry’s authority
over “the English Church, whose Protector and
supreme Head he alone is,” to cover even spiritual
jurisdiction, on the other hand, Warham and the
English Bishops evidently did intend it to cover only
an admission that the king had taken all jurisdiction in
temporals, hitherto exercised by the Pope in England,
into his own hands.</p>

<p>Moreover, looking at what was demanded and at
what was granted by the clergy, there is little room
for doubt that they at first deliberately eliminated any
acknowledgment of the Royal jurisdiction. This deduction
is turned into a certainty by the subsequent
action of Archbishop Warham. He first protested that
the admission was not to be twisted in “derogation
of the Roman Pontiff or the Apostolic See,” and the
very last act of his life was the drafting of an elaborate
exposition, to be delivered in the House of Lords, of
the impossibility of the king’s having spiritual jurisdiction,
from the very nature of the constitution of
the Christian Church. Such jurisdiction, he claimed,
belonged of right to the Roman See.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>That the admission wrung from the clergy in fact
formed the thin end of the wedge which finally severed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the English Church from the spiritual jurisdiction of the
Holy See is obvious. But the “thin end” was, there
can be hardly any doubt, the temporal aspect of the
authority of the Roman See; and that its insertion at
all was possible may be said in greater measure to be
due to the fact that the exercise of jurisdiction in
temporals by a foreign authority had long been a
matter which many Englishmen had strongly resented.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">CLERGY AND LAITY</span></h2>

<p>It is very generally asserted that on the eve of the
Reformation the laity in England had no particular
love or respect for churchmen. That there were
grave difficulties and disagreements between the two
estates is supposed to be certain. On the face of it,
however, the reason and origin of what is frequently
called “the grudge” of laymen against the ecclesiastics
is obviously much misunderstood. Its extent is
exaggerated, its origin put at an earlier date than
should be assigned to it, and the whole meaning of
the points at issue interpreted quite unnecessarily as
evidence of a popular and deep-seated disbelief in the
prevailing ecclesiastical system. To understand the
temper of people and priest in those times, it is obviously
necessary to examine into this question in
some detail. We are not without abundant material
in the literature of the period for forming a judgment
as to the relations which then existed between the
clerical and lay elements in the State. Fortunately,
not only have we assertions on the one side and on
the other as to the questions at issue, but the whole
matter was debated at the time in a series of tracts
by two eminent laymen. This discussion was carried
on between an anonymous writer, now recognised as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the lawyer, Christopher Saint-German, and Sir Thomas
More himself.</p>

<p>Christopher Saint-German, who is chiefly known
as the writer of a <i>Dyalogue in English between a Student
of Law and a Doctor of Divinity</i>, belonged to the Inner
Temple, and was, it has already been said, a lawyer
of considerable repute. About the year 1532, a tract
from his pen called <i>A treatise concerning the division
between the spiritualtie and temporaltie</i> appeared anonymously.
To this Sir Thomas More, who had just
resigned the office of Chancellor, replied in his celebrated
<i>Apology</i>, published in 1533. Saint-German
rejoined in the same year with <i>A Dyalogue between
two Englishmen, whereof one is called Salem and the other
Bizance</i>, More immediately retorting with the <i>Debellacyon
of Salem and Bizance</i>. In these four treatises
the whole matter of the supposed feud between the
clergy and laity is thrashed out, and the points at
issue are clearly stated and discussed.</p>

<p>Christopher Saint-German’s position is at first somewhat
difficult to understand. By some of his contemporaries
he was considered to have been tainted by “the
new teaching” in doctrinal matters, which at the time
he wrote was making some headway in England. He
himself, however, professes to write as a loyal believer in
the teaching of the Church, but takes exception to certain
ecclesiastical laws and customs which in his opinion are
no necessary part of the system at all. In these he
thinks he detects the cause of the “division that had
risen between the spiritualtie and the temporaltie.”
Sir Thomas More, it may be remarked, is always careful
to treat the writer as if he believed him to be a sincere
Catholic, though mistaken in both the extent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
existing disaffection to the Church and altogether impracticable
in the remedies he suggested. In some
things it must, however, be confessed, granting Saint-German’s
facts, that he shows weighty grounds for some
grievance against the clergy on the part of the laity.</p>

<p><i>The treatise concerning the division</i> begins by expressing
regret at the unfortunate state of things which
the author pre-supposes as existing in England when
he wrote in 1532, contrasting it with what he remembered
before. “Who may remember the state of this
realm now in these days,” he writes, “without great
heaviness and sorrow of heart? For whereas, in times
past, there has reigned charity, meekness, concord, and
peace, there now reigns envy, pride, division, and strife,
and that not only between laymen and churchmen, but
also between religious and religious, and between priests
and religious, and what is more to be lamented also
between priests and priests. This division has been so
universal that it has been a great (cause of) disquiet
and a great breach of charity through all the realm.”<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>It must be confessed that if this passage is to be
taken as it stands, the division would appear to have
been very widely spread at the time. Sir Thomas More,
whilst denying that the difficulty was so great as Saint-German
would make out, admits that in late years the
spirit had grown and was still growing apace. He
holds, however, that Saint-German’s reasons for its existence
are not the true ones, and that his methods will
only serve to increase the spirit of division. As regards
the quarrels between religious, at which Saint-German
expresses his indignation, he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> “Except this man
means here by religious folk, either women and children
with whose variances the temporality is not very much
disturbed, or else the lay brethren, who are in some
places of religion, and who are neither so many nor so
much esteemed, that ever the temporality was much
troubled at their strife, besides this there is no variance
between religious and religious with which the temporality
have been offended.”<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Again: “Of some particular
variance among divers persons of the clergy I have
indeed heard, as sometimes one against another for his
tithes, or a parson against a religious place for meddling
with his parish, or one place of religion with another
upon some such like occasions, or sometime some one
religious (order) have had some question and dispute
as to the antiquity or seniority of its institution, as (for
instance) the Carmelites claim to derive their origin
from Elias and Eliseus: and some question has arisen
in the Order of Saint Francis between the Observants
and the Conventuals (for of the third company, that is
to say the Colettines, there are none in this realm).
But of all these matters, as far as I have read or
remember, there were never in this realm either so
very great or so many such (variances) all at once,
that it was ever at the time remarked through the realm
and spoken of as a great and notable fault of the whole
clergy.” Particular faults and petty quarrels should not
be considered the cause of any great grudge against the
clergy at large. “And as it is not in reason that it
should be, so in fact it is not so, as may be understood
from this:” …<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> “if it were the case, then must this
grudge of ours against them have been a very old thing,
whereas it is indeed neither so great as this man maketh
out, nor grown to so great (a pass) as it is, but only
even so late as Tyndale’s books and Frith’s and Friar
Barnes’ began to go abroad.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Further, in several places Sir Thomas More emphatically
asserts that the talking against the clergy,
the hostile feeling towards them, and the dissensions
said to exist between them and lay folk generally, were
only of very recent origin, and were at worst not very
serious. “I have, within these four or five years (for
before I heard little talk of such things),” he writes,
“been present at such discussions in divers good companies,
never talking in earnest thereof (for as yet I
thank God that I never heard such talk), but as a pass-time
and in the way of familiar talking, I have heard at
such times some in hand with prelates and secular
priests and religious persons, and talk of their lives,
and their learning, and of their livelihood too, and as
to whether they were such, that it were better to have
them or not to have them. Then touching their livelihood
(it was debated), whether it might be lawfully
taken away from them or no; and if it might, whether
it were expedient for it to be taken, and if so for what
use.”<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>To this Saint-German replies at length in his <i>Salem
and Bizance</i>, and says that Sir Thomas More must have
known that the difficulties had their origin long before
the rise of the new religious views, and were not in any
sense founded upon the opinions of the modern heretics.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
More answers by reasserting his position that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
“the division is nothing such as this man makes it, and
is grown as great as it is only since Tyndale’s books
and Frith’s and Friar Barnes’ began to be spread
abroad.” And in answer to Saint-German’s suggestion
that he should look a little more closely into the
matter, he says: “Indeed, with better looking thereon
I find it somewhat otherwise. For I find the time
of such increase as I speak of much shorter than I
assigned, and that by a great deal. For it has grown
greater” by reason of “the book upon the division,”
which Saint-German with the best of intentions had
circulated among the people.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Putting one book against the other, it would appear
then tolerably certain that the rise of the anti-clerical
spirit in England must be dated only just before the
dawn of the Reformation, when the popular mind was
being stirred up by the new teachers against the clergy.
There seems, moreover, no reason to doubt the positive
declaration of Sir Thomas More, who had every means
of knowing, that the outcry was modern&mdash;so modern
indeed that it was practically unknown only four or
five years before 1533, and that it originated undoubtedly
from the dissemination of Lutheran views
and teachings by Tyndale and others. It is useful to
examine well into the grounds upon which this anti-clerical
campaign was conducted, and to note the
chief causes of objection to the clergy which are found
set forth by Saint-German in his books. In the first
place: “Some say,” he writes, that priests and religious
“keep not the perfection of their order,” and do not
set that good example to the people “they should do.”
Some also work for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> “their own honour, and call it the
honour of God, and rather covet to have rule over the
people than to profit the people.” Others think more
about their “bodily ease and worldly wealth and meat
and drink,” and the like, even more than lay people do.
Others, again, serve God “for worldly motives, to obtain
the praise of men, to enrich themselves and the like,
and not from any great love of God.”</p>

<p>Such is the first division of the general accusations
which Saint-German states were popularly made against
the clergy in 1532. Against these may be usefully set
Sir Thomas More’s examination of the charges, and his
own opinion as to the state of the clergy. In his previous
works he had, he says, forborne to use words
unpleasant either to the clergy or laity about themselves,
though he had “confessed what is true, namely,
that neither were faultless.” But what had offended
“these blessed brethren,” the English followers of
Luther, was that “I have not hesitated to say, what
I also take for the very truth, that as this realm of
England has, God be thanked, as good and praiseworthy
a temporality, number for number, as any
other Christian country of equal number has had, so
has it had also, number for number, compared with
any other realm of no greater number in Christendom,
as good and as commendable a clergy. In both there
have never been wanting plenty of those who have
always been ‘naught’; but their faults have ever been
their own and should not be imputed to the whole
body, neither in the spirituality nor temporality.”<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Turning to the special accusation made by Saint-German
that ecclesiastics “do not keep the perfection
of their order,” More grants that this may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> “not be
much untrue.” For “Man’s duty to God is so great
that very few serve Him as they should do.”…“But,
I suppose, they keep it now at this day much after
such a good metely manner as they did in the years
before, during which this division was never dreamed
of, and therefore those who say this is the cause have
need to go seek some other.”<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> To the second point
his reply is equally clear. It is true, More thinks,
that some ecclesiastics do look perhaps to their own
honour and profit, but, he asks, “were there never
any such till so lately as the beginning of this division,
or are all of them like this now?” No doubt there
are some such, and “I pray God that when any new
ones shall come they may prove no worse. For of
these, if they wax not worse before they die, those who
shall live after them may, in my mind, be bold to say
that England had not their betters any time these forty
years, and I dare go for a good way beyond this too.
But this is more than twenty years, and ten before this
division” (between the clergy and laity) was heard of.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
Further, as far as his own opinion goes, although there
may be, and probably are, some priests and religious
whom the world accounts good and virtuous, who are
yet at heart evil-minded, this is no reason to despise
or condemn the whole order. Equally certain is it
that besides such there are “many very virtuous, holy
men indeed, whose holiness and prayer have been, I
verily believe, one great special cause that God has
so long held His hand from letting some heavier stroke
fall on the necks of those whether in the spirituality
or temporality who are naught and care not.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>In his <i>Apology</i>, Sir Thomas More protested against
the author of the work on the <i>Division</i> translating a
passage from the Latin of John Gerson, about the evil
lives of priests; and on Saint-German excusing himself
in his second book, More returns to the point in <i>The
Debellation of Salem and Bizance</i>. More had pleaded
that his opponent had dragged the faults of the clergy
into light rather than those of the laity, because if the
priests led good lives, as St. John Chrysostom had said,
the whole Church would be in a good state; “and if
they were corrupt, the faith and virtue of the people
fades also and vanishes away.” “Surely, good readers,”
exclaims More, “I like these words well.” They are
very good, and they prove “the matter right well, and
very true is it, nor did I ever say the contrary, but
have in my <i>Apology</i> plainly said the same: that every
fault in a spiritual man is, by the difference of the
person, far worse and more odious to God and man
than if it were in a temporal man.” And indeed the
saying of St. Chrysostom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> “were in part the very cause
that made me write against his (<i>i.e.</i> Saint-German’s) book.
For assuredly, as St. Chrysostom says: ‘If the priesthood
be corrupt, the faith and virtue of the people
fades and vanishes away.’ This is without any question
very true, for though St. Chrysostom had never said it,
our Saviour says as much himself. ‘Ye are (saith He
to the clergy) the salt of the earth.’ … But, I say,
since the priesthood is corrupted it must needs follow
that the faith and virtue of the people fades and
vanishes away, and on Christ’s words it must follow
that, if the spirituality be nought, the temporality must
needs be worse than they. I, upon this, conclude
on the other side against this ‘Pacifier’s’ book, that
since this realm has (as God be thanked indeed it has)
as good and as faithful a temporality (though there be
a few false brethren in a great multitude of true Catholic
men) as any other Christian country of equal size has,
it must needs, I say, follow that the clergy (though it
have some such false evil brethren too) is not so
sorely corrupted as the book of <i>Division</i> would make
people think, but on their side they are as good as the
temporality are on theirs.”<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>On one special point Saint-German insists very
strongly. As it is a matter upon which much has been
said, and upon which people are inclined to believe the
worst about the pre-Reformation clergy, it may be
worth while to give his views at some length, and then
take Sir Thomas More’s opinion also on the subject. It
is on the eternal question of the riches of the Church,
and the supposed mercenary spirit which pervaded the
clergy. “Some lay people say,” writes Saint-German,
“that however much religious men have disputed
amongst themselves as to the pre-eminence of their
particular state in all such things as pertain to the
maintenance of the worldly honour of the Church and
of spiritual men, which they call the honour of God,
and in all such things as pertain to the increase of
the riches of spiritual men, all, religious or secular,
agree as one.” For this reason it is found that religious
men are much more earnest in trying to induce
people to undertake and support such works
as produce money for themselves, such as trentals,
chantries, obits, pardons, and pilgrimages, than in
insisting upon the payments of debts, upon restitution
for wrong done, or upon works of mercy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> “to their
neighbours poor and needy&mdash;sometimes in extreme
necessity.”<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas More replies that those who object in
this way, object not so much because the trentals, &amp;c.,
tend to make priests rich, but because they “hate” the
things themselves. Indeed, some of these things are
not such that they make priests so very rich, in fact, as
to induce them to use all endeavour to procure them.
The chantries, for example, “though they are many, no
one man can make any very great living out of them;
and that a priest should have some living of such a
mean thing as the chantries commonly are, no good
man will find great fault.” As for pilgrimages, “though
the shrines are well garnished, and the chapel well
hanged with wax (candles), few men nowadays, I fear,
can have much cause to grudge or complain of the
great offerings required from them. Those men make
the most ado who offer nothing at all.” And with
regard to “pardons,” it should be remembered that
they were procured often “by the good faithful
devotion of virtuous secular princes, as was the great
pardon purchased for Westminster and the Savoy” by
Henry VII. “And in good faith I never yet perceived,”
he says, “that people make such great offerings
at a pardon that we should either much pity their
expense or envy the priests that profit.”</p>

<p>“But then the trentals! Lo, they are the things, as
you well know, by which the multitude of the clergy and
specially the prelates, all get an infinite treasure each
year.” For himself, Sir Thomas More hopes and
“beseeches God to keep men devoted to the trentals
and obits too.” But where this “Pacifier” asserts that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
“some say that all spiritual men as a body induce people
to pilgrimages, pardons, chantries, obits, and trentals,
rather than to the payment of their debts, or to restitution
of their wrongs, or to deeds of mercy to their
neighbours that are poor and needy, and sometimes in
extreme necessity, for my part, I thank God,” he says,
“that I never heard yet of any one who ever would
give that counsel, and no more has this ‘Pacifier’ himself,
for he says it only under his common figure of
‘some say.’”<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>In his second reply, More returns to the same
subject. Saint-German speaks much, he says, about
“restitution.” This, should there be need, no reasonable
man would object to. “But now the matter
standeth all in this way: this man talks as if the
spirituality were very busy to procure men and induce
people (generally) to give money for trentals, to found
chantries and obits, to obtain pardons and to go on
pilgrimages, leaving their debts unpaid and restitution
unmade which should be done first, and that this was
the custom of the spirituality. In this,” says More,
“standeth the question.” The point is not whether
debts and restitution should be satisfied before all other
things, which all will allow, but whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> “multitude
of the clergy, that is to say either all but a few, or at
least the most part, solicit and labour lay people to do
these (voluntary) things rather than pay their debts or
make restitution for their wrongs.… That the multitude
of priests do this, I never heard any honest man
for very shame say. For I think it were hard to meet
with a priest so wretched, who, were he asked his
advice and counsel on that point, would not in so plain
a matter, though out of very shame, well and plainly
counsel the truth, and if perchance there were found any
so shameless as to give contrary counsel, I am very
sure they would be by far the fewer, and not as this
good man’s first book says, the greater part and multitude.”
What, therefore, More blames so much is, that
under pretext of an altogether “untrue report” the
clergy generally are held up to obloquy and their good
name slandered.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> If he thinks that “I do but mock
him to my poor wit, I think it somewhat more civility
in some such points as this to mock him a little merrily,
than with odious earnest arguments to discuss matters
seriously with him.”</p>

<p>In some things even Saint-German considers the
outcry raised against the clergy unreasonable. But
then, as he truly says, many “work rather upon will
than upon reason,” and though possessed of great and
good zeal are lacking in necessary discretion. Thus
some people, seeing the evils that come to the Church
from riches, “have held the opinion that it was not lawful
for the Church to have any possessions.” Others,
“taking a more mean way,” have thought that the
Church ought not to have “that great abundance that”
it has, for this induces a love of riches in churchmen and
“hinders, and in a manner strangles, the love of God.”
These last would-be reformers of churchmen advocate
taking away all that is not necessary. Others, again,
have gone a step further still, “and because great riches
have come to the Church for praying for souls in Purgatory,
have affirmed that there is no Purgatory.” In
the same way such men would be against pardons,
pilgrimages, and chantries. They outwardly appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
“to rise against all these … and to despise them, and
yet in their hearts they know and believe that all such
things are of themselves right good and profitable, as
indeed they are, if they are ordered as they should
be.”<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas More truly says that what is implied in
this outcry against the riches of the clergy is that as a
body they lead idle, luxurious, if not vicious lives. It
is easy enough to talk in this way, but how many men
in secular occupations, he asks, would be willing to
change? There might be “some who would, and
gladly would, have become prelates (for I have heard
many laymen who would very willingly have been
bishops), and there might be found enough to match
those that are evil and naughty secular priests, and
those too who have run away from the religious life,
and these would, and were able to, match them in their
own ways were they never so bad. Yet, as the world
goes now, it would not be very easy, I ween, to find
sufficient to match the good, even though they be as
few as some folk would have them to be.”</p>

<p>In the fifteenth chapter of his book on the <i>Division</i>,
Saint-German deals specially with the religious life and
with what in his opinion people think about it, and
about those who had given up their liberty for a life in
the cloister. The matter is important, and considerable
extracts are necessary fully to understand the position.
“Another cause” of the dislike of the clergy by the
laity is to be sought for in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> “great laxity and liberty
of living that people have seen in religious men. For
they say, that though religious men profess obedience
and poverty, yet many of them have and will have their
own will, with plenty of delicate food in such abundance
that no obedience or poverty appears in them. For
this reason many have said, and yet say to the present
day, that religious men have the most pleasant and
delicate life that any men have. And truly, if we
behold the holiness and blessed examples of the holy
fathers, and of many religious persons that have lived
in times past, and of many that now live in these days,
we should see right great diversity between them. For
many of them, I trow, as great diversity as between
heaven and hell.” Then, after quoting the eighteenth
chapter of <i>The Following of Christ</i>, he proceeds: “Thus
far goeth the said chapter. But the great pity is that
most men say that at the present day many religious
men will rather follow their own will than the will of
their superior, and that they will neither suffer hunger
nor thirst, heat nor cold, nakedness, weariness nor
labour, but will have riches, honour, dignities, friends,
and worldly acquaintances, the attendance of servants
at their commands, pleasure and disports, and that
more liberally than temporal men have. Thus, say
some, are they fallen from true religion, whereby the
devotion of the people is in a manner fallen from
them.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>“Nevertheless, I doubt not that there are many
right good and virtuous religious persons. God forbid
that it should be otherwise. But it is said that there
are many evil, and that in such a multitude that those
who are good cannot, or will not, see them reformed.
And one great cause that hinders reform is this: if the
most dissolute person in all the community, and the
one who lives most openly against the rules of religion,
can use this policy, namely, to extol his (form of)
religious life above all others, pointing them out as not
being so perfect as that to which he belongs, anon he
shall be called a good fervent brother, and one that
supports his Order, and for this reason his offences
shall be looked on the more lightly.”</p>

<p>“Another thing that has caused many people to
mislike religious has been the great extremity that has
been many times witnessed at the elections of abbots,
priors, and such other spiritual sovereigns. And this is
a general ground, for when religious men perceive that
people mislike them, they in their hearts withdraw their
favour and devotion again from them. And in this way
charity has waxed cold between them.”</p>

<p>“And verily, I suppose, that it were better that there
should be no abbot or prior hereafter allowed to continue
over a certain number of years, and that these
should be appointed by the authority of the rulers,
rather than have such extremities at elections, as in
many places has been used in times past.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>“And verily, it seems to me, one thing would do
great good concerning religious Orders and all religious
persons, and that is this: that the Rules and Constitutions
of religious bodies should be examined and well
considered, whether their rigour and straightness can
be borne now in these days as they were at the beginning
of the religious Orders. For people be nowadays
weaker, as to the majority of men, than they were then.
And if it is thought that they (<i>i.e.</i> the Rules) cannot now
be kept, that then such relaxations and interpretations
of their rules be made, as shall be thought expedient by
the rulers. Better it is to have an easy rule well kept,
than a strict rule broken without correction. For,
thereof followeth a boldness to offend, a quiet heart in
an evil conscience: a custom in sin, with many an ill
example to the people. By this many have found fault
at all religious life, where they should rather have found
fault at divers abuses against the true religion. Certain
it is that religious life was first ordained by the holy
fathers by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, keep it
who so may.”<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Much of this criticism on the state of the religious
orders on the eve of the Reformation is obviously only
very general, and would apply to all states of society,
composed, as such bodies are, of human members.
With much that Saint-German suggests, it is impossible
not to agree in principle, however difficult the attainment
of the ideal may be in practice. Sir Thomas
More, whilst admitting that there were undoubtedly
things requiring correction in the religious life of the
period, maintains most strongly that in practical working
it was far better than any one would gather from
the assertions and suggestions of Saint-German, and
that in reality, with all their carping at laxity and worldliness,
none of the critics of the monks would be willing
to change places with them. “As wealthy,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
“and as easy and as glorious as some tell ‘the pacifier’ religious
life is, yet if some other would say to them: ‘Lo
sirs, those folks who are in religion shall out, come you
into religion in their steads; live there better than they
do, and you shall have heaven,’ they would answer, I fear
me, that they are not weary of the world. And even if
they were invited into religion another way, and it was
said to them, ‘Sir, we will not bid you live so straight
in religion as these men should have done; come on
enter, and do just as they did, and then you will have a
good, easy, and wealthy life, and much worldly praise
for it,’&mdash;I ween for all that, a man would not get them
to go into it. But as easy as we call it, and as wealthy
too&mdash;and now peradventure when our wives are angry
we wish ourselves therein&mdash;were it offered … I ween
that for all our words, if that easy and wealthy life that
is in religion were offered to us, even as weary as we
are of wedding, we would rather bear all our pain
abroad than take a religious man’s life of ease in the
cloister.”<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>With some of the accusations of Saint-German, or
rather with some of his explanations of the supposed
“grudge” borne by the laity to the clergy, More has
hardly the patience to deal. They, the clergy, and above
all religious, should, the former says, “give alms and
wear hair (shirts), and fast and pray that this division
may cease.” “Pray, wear hair, fast, and give alms,” says
the latter; “why, what else do they do as a rule? Some
may not; but then there were some negligent in those
matters for the past thousand years, and so the present
negligence of a few can’t be the cause of the dissension
now.” “But this ‘pacifier,’ perceiving that what one
man does in secret another cannot see, is therefore bold
to say they do not do all those things he would have
them do; that is to say, fast, pray, wear hair (shirts),
and give alms. For he says ‘that they do all these
things it appears not.’”</p>

<p>Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> “as to praying, it appears indeed that they do
this; and that so much that they daily pray, as some
of us lay men think it a pain (to do) once a week; to
rise so soon from sleep and to wait so long fasting, as
on a Sunday to come and hear out their matins. And
yet the matins in every parish is neither begun so early
nor so long in the saying as it is in the Charter house
you know well; and yet at the sloth and gluttony of us,
who are lay people, he can wink and fan himself asleep.
But as soon as the lips of the clergy stop moving he
quickly spies out that they are not praying.”</p>

<p>And “now as touching on alms: Is there none
given, does he think, by the spirituality? If he say, as
he does, that it does not appear that they do give alms,
I might answer again that they but follow in this the
counsel of Christ which says: ‘Let not the left hand
see what thy right hand doeth.’… But as God, for
all that counsel, was content that men should both pray
and give to the needy and do other works both of
penance and of charity openly and abroad, where there
is no desire of vain glory, but that the people by the
sight thereof might have occasion therefore to give laud
and praise to God, so I dare say boldly that they, both
secretly and openly too, … give no little alms in the
year, whatsoever this ‘pacifier’ do say. And I somewhat
marvel, since he goes so busily abroad that there
is no ‘some say,’ almost in the whole realm, which he
does not hear and repeat it; I marvel, I say, not a little
that he neither sees nor hears from any ‘some say’
that there is almsgiving in the spirituality; I do not
much myself go very far abroad, and yet I hear ‘some
say’ that there is; and I myself see sometimes so many
poor folk at Westminster at the doles, of whom, as far
as I have ever heard, the monks are not wont to send
many away unserved, that I have myself for the press
of them been fain to ride another way.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>“But to this, some one once answered me and
said; ‘that it was no thanks to them, for it (came
from) lands that good princes have given them.’ But,
as I then told him, it was then much less thanks to
them that would now give good princes evil counsel to
take it from them. And also if we are to call it not
giving of alms by them, because other good men have
given them the lands from which they give it, from
what will you have them give alms? They have no
other.…”</p>

<p>Further replying to the insinuation of Saint-German
that the religious keep retainers and servants out of
pride and for “proud worldly countenance,” Sir Thomas
More says: “If men were as ready in regard to a deed
of their own, by nature indifferent, to construe the
mind and intent of the doer to the better part, as they
are, of their own inward goodness, to construe and
report it to the worst, then might I say, that the very
thing which they call ‘the proud worldly countenance’
they might and should call charitable alms. That is to
say, (when they furnish) the right honest keep and
good bringing up of so many temporal men in their
service, who though not beggars yet perhaps the
greater part of them might have to beg if they did
not support them but sent them out to look for some
service for themselves,” (they are giving charitable
alms).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>“And just as if you would give a poor man some
money because he was in need and yet would make
him go and work for it in your garden, lest by your
alms he should live idle and become a loiterer, the
labour he does, does not take away the nature nor
merit of alms: so neither is the keeping of servants
no alms, though they may wait on the finder and serve
him in his house. And of all alms the chief is, to see
people well brought up and well and honestly guided.
In which point, though neither part do fully their duty,
yet I believe in good faith that in this matter, which is
no small alms, the spirituality is rather somewhat before
us than in any way drags behind.”<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the charge brought against the
clergy of great laxity in fasting and mortification, More
thinks this is really a point on which he justly can
make merry. Fasting, he says, must be regulated according
to custom and the circumstances of time and
place. If there were to be a cast-iron rule for fasting,
then, when compared with primitive times, people in
his day, since they dined at noon, could not be held to
fast at all. And yet “the Church to condescend to
our infirmity” has allowed men “to say their evensong
in Lent before noon,” in order that they might not break
their fast before the vesper hour. The fact is that, in
More’s opinion, a great deal of the outcry about the
unmortified lives of the religious and clergy had “been
made in Germany” by those who desired to throw off
all such regulations for themselves. As a Teuton had
said to him in “Almaine” colloquial English&mdash;“when I
blamed him,” More says, “for not fasting on a certain
day: ‘Fare to sould te laye men fasten? let te prester
fasten.’ So we, God knows, begin to fast very little
ourselves, but bid the ‘prester to fasten.’”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>“And as to such mortifications as the wearing of
hair shirts, it would indeed be hard to bind men,
even priests, to do this, … though among them
many do so already, and some whole religious bodies
too.” If he says, as he does, that this “does not
appear,” what would he have? Would he wish them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to publish to the world these penances? If they
take his, Saint-German’s, advice, “they will come out
of their cloisters every man into the market-place,
and there kneel down in the gutters, and make their
prayers in the open streets, and wear their hair shirts
over their cowls, and then it shall appear and men
shall see it. And truly in this way there will be no
hypocrisy for their shirts of hair, and yet moreover
it will be a good policy, for then they will not prick
them.”<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>In the same way More points out that people in
talking against the wealth of the clergy are not less
unreasonable than they are when criticising what they
call their idle, easy lives. “Not indeed that we might
not be able always to find plenty content to enter
into their possessions, though we could not always
find men enough content to enter their religions;”
but when the matter is probed to the bottom, and
it is a question how their wealth “would be better
bestowed,” then “such ways as at the first face seemed
very good and very charitable for the comfort and
help of poor folk, appeared after reasoning more likely
in a short while to make many more beggars than
to relieve those that are so already. And some other
ways that at first appeared for the greater advantage
of the realm, and likely to increase the king’s honour
and be a great strength for the country, and a great
security for the prince as well as a great relief of
the people’s charges, appeared clearly after further
discussion to be ‘clean contrary, and of all other
ways the worst.’”</p>

<p>“And to say the truth,” he continues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> “I much
marvel to see some folk now speak so much and
boldly about taking away any possessions of the
clergy.” For though once in the reign of Henry
IV., “about the time of a great rumble that the
heretics made, when they would have destroyed not
only the clergy but the king and his nobility also,
there was a foolish and false bill or two put into
Parliament and dismissed as they deserved; yet in
all my time, when I was conversant with the court,
I had never found of all the nobility of this land
more than seven (of which seven there are now three
dead) who thought that it was either right or reasonable,
or could be any way profitable to the realm,
without lawful cause to take away from the clergy
any of the possessions which good and holy princes,
and other devout, virtuous people, of whom many
now are blessed saints in heaven, have of devotion
towards God given to the clergy to serve God and
pray for all Christian souls.”<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>In his <i>Confutation of Tyndale’s Answer</i>, made in
1532, when Sir Thomas More was still Lord Chancellor
of England, he protests against imputations
made by his adversary and his follower Barnes, that
the clergy were as a body corrupt. “Friar Barnes
lasheth out against them, against their pride and
pomp, and all their lives spent in” vicious living,
“as if there were not a good priest in all the Catholic
Church.… He jesteth on them because they wear
crowns and long gowns, and the bishops wear rochets.
And he hath likened them to bulls, asses, and apes,
and the rochets to smocks.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> “But he forgets how
many good virtuous priests and religious people be
put out of their places (in Germany) and spoiled of
their living, and beaten, and sent out a-begging, while
heretics and apostates, with their women, keep their
shameless lives with the living that holy folks have
dedicated unto God for the support of such as would
serve God in spiritual cleanness and vowed chastity.
He knows well enough, I warrant you, that the clergy
can never lack persecution where heretics may grow;
nor soon after the temporality either, as it has hitherto
been proved in every such country yet.”<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>He will not repeat all his “ribald railing upon all
the clergy of Christendom who will not be heretics”
when he calls “them bulls, apes, asses and abominable
harlots and devils.” … “No good man doubts,
although among the clergy there are many full bad
(as, indeed, it were hard to have it otherwise among
so great a multitude, whilst Christ’s own twelve were
not without a traitor), that there are again among
them many right virtuous folk, and such that the whole
world beside fares the better for their holy living and
their devout prayer.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Beyond the above supposed causes for the growth
of the dislike of the clergy which Sir Thomas More
weighs and considers in the above extracts, Saint-German
gives others which are instructive as to the
actual status of the clergy; but with which, as they
do not reflect upon their moral character, Sir Thomas
More was not immediately concerned in his reply.
One occasion of the present difficulties and division,
writes Saint-German, “has partly arisen by temporal
men who have desired much the familiarity of priests
in their games and sports, and who were wont to make
much more of those who were companionable than of
those that were not so, and have called them good
fellows and good companions. And many also would
have chaplains which they would not only suffer, but
also command, to go hunting, hawking, and such other
vain disports; and some would let them lie among
other lay servants, where they could neither use prayer
nor contemplation.”</p>

<p>Some even go so far as to insist on their chaplains
wearing “liveries,” which “are not convenient in
colour for a priest to wear.” Others give them worldly
businesses to attend to in the way of stewardships, &amp;c.,
“so that in this way their inward devotion of heart has
become as cold and as weak, in a manner, as it is in
lay men.” Nevertheless, in spite of the evil effect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
be feared from this training, they do not hesitate to
put them into the first benefice they have to dispose
of; “and when they have done so, they will anon
speak evil of priests, and report great lightness in
them, and lightly compare the faults of one priest
with another.” This they do “even when they themselves
have been partly the occasion of their offences.”</p>

<p>Moreover, “where by the law all priests ought to
be at the (parish) church on Sundays and holidays, and
help the service of God in the choir, and also, when
there, to be under the orders of the curate (or parish
priest of the place), yet nevertheless many men who
have chaplains will not allow them to come to the
parish church; and when they are there, will not
suffer them to receive their orders from the curate,
but only from themselves; nor will they tolerate seeing
them in the choir;” and what is the case with “chaplains
and serving priests is also (true) of chantry priests
and brotherhood priests in many places.”</p>

<p>To remedy these evils, Saint-German thinks, as
indeed every one would be disposed to agree with him,
that priests should be prohibited from hunting and
all such games as are unsuitable to the priestly character,
“though perchance he may, as for recreation, use
honest disportes for a time.” Moreover, he should not
“frequent the ale house or tavern,” and, if in his
recreations the people are offended, he should be
warned by “an abbot and a justice of the peace of
the shire.” If, after this, he does not change, he ought
to be suspended. Further than this, no one should be
permitted to have a chaplain who has not “a standing
house,” where the priest is able to have his private
chamber with a lock and key, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> “he may use
himself therein conveniently in reading, prayer, or
contemplation, or such other labours and business as
it is convenient for a priest to use.”<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Both in his work on the <i>Division</i> and in his previous
tract, <i>A Dyalogue between a Student of Law and a Doctor of
Divinity</i>, Saint-German lays great stress upon the question
of mortuaries, as one that gave great offence to
lay people at the period when he wrote. As he explained
in the <i>Dyalogue</i>, the State had already interfered
to regulate the exactions made by custom at funerals,
but nevertheless “in some places the Church claims
to have the taper that stands in the middle of the
hearse over the heart of the corpse, and some claim
to have all the tapers. Some also claim to have one
of the torches that is about the hearse, and others to
have all the torches. And if the body be brought in
a charette or with coat armour or such other (ornaments),
then they claim all the horses and charette
and the apparel or part thereof.”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Now, in his other
book, Saint-German thinks that though these things
“are annulled already by statute,” there is rising
up “a thing concerning mortuaries,” that “if it be
allowed to continue” will cause great difficulties in
the near future. It is this: “Many curates not regarding
the king’s statute in that behalf, persuade their
parishioners when they are sick to believe that they
cannot be saved unless they restore them as much
as the old mortuary would have amounted to.” All
those who act in such a way are, he thinks, “bound
in conscience to restitution, since they have obtained
money under false information.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>After arguing that Parliament has a right to legislate
in all matters concerning goods and property, our
author says: “It is certain that all such mortuaries
were temporal goods, though they were claimed by
spiritual men; and the cause why they were taken
away was, because there were few things within this
realm which caused more variance among the people
than they did, when they were allowed. They were
taken so far against the king’s laws and against justice
and right, as shall hereafter appear. First they were
taken not only after the husband’s death, but also after
the death of the wife, who by the law of the realm had
no goods, but what were the husband’s. They were
taken also from servants and children, as well infants
as others; and if a man died on a journey and had a
household, he should pay mortuaries in both places.”
Whilst in some places both the parson and the vicar
claimed the mortuary; “and sometime even the curate
(<i>i.e.</i> parish priest) would prohibit poor men to sell
their goods, as were likely to come to them as mortuaries,
for they would say it was done in order to
defraud the Church.” And the mortuaries had to be
handed over at once, or they would not bury the body.
All these things led to the great growth of mortuaries
“by the prescription of the spiritual law, and had they
not been put an end to by Parliament they would have
grown more and more.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>“And in many places they were taken in such a
way that it made the people think that their curates
loved their mortuaries better than their lives. For this
reason there rose in many places great division and
grudge between them, which caused a breach of the
peace, love, and charity that ought to be between the
curate and his parishioners, to the great unquietness of
many of the king’s subjects, as well spiritual as temporal,
and to the great danger and peril of their souls.
For these causes the said mortuaries be annulled by
Parliament, as well in conscience as in law, and yet it
is said that some curates use great extremities concerning
the said mortuaries another way; and that is this:
If at the first request the executor pay not the money
that is appointed by the statute, they will anon have a
citation against him, and in this he shall be so handled
that, as it is said, it would have been generally much
better for him to have paid the old mortuary, than the
costs and expenses he will then have to pay.”<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Another fertile cause of complaint against the clergy
at this time was, in Saint-German’s opinion, the way in
which tithes were exacted; in many cases without much
consideration for justice and reason.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> “In some places,
the curates all exact their tenth of everything within
the parish that is subject to tithe, although their predecessors
from time immemorial have been contented to
do without it: and this even though there is sufficient
besides for the curates to live upon, and though perchance
in old time something else has been assigned in
place of it. In some places there has been asked, it is
said, tithe of both chickens and eggs; in some places
of milk and cheese; and in some others tithe of the
ground and also of all that falleth to the ground. In
other places tithes of servants’ wages is claimed without
any deduction; and indeed it is in but few places that
any servant shall go quite without some payment of
tithe, though he may have spent all in sickness, or upon
his father and mother, or such necessary expenses.”</p>

<p>Our author, from whom we get so much information
as to the relations which existed in pre-Reformation
times between the clergy and people, goes on to give
additional instances of the possible hardships incidental
to the collection of the ecclesiastical dues. These,
where they exist, he, no doubt rightly, thinks do not
tend to a good understanding between those who have
the cure of souls, and who ought to be regarded rather
in the light of spiritual fathers, than of worldly tax collectors.
He admits, however, that these are the abuses
of the few, and must not be considered as universally
true of all the clergy. “And though,” he concludes,
“these abusions are not used universally (God forbid
that they should), for there are many good curates
and other spiritual men that would not use them to win
any earthly thing, yet when people of divers countries
meet together, and one tells another of some such
extremity used by some curates in his country, and the
other in like manner to him, soon they come to think
that such covetousness and harsh dealing is common to
all curates. And although they do not well in so doing,
for the offence of one priest is no offence of any other,
if they will so take it: yet spiritual men themselves do
nothing to bring the people out of this judgment; but
allow these abuses to be used by some without correcting
them.”<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>To these objections, and more of the same kind, Sir
Thomas More did not make, and apparently did not
think it at all necessary to make, any formal reply.
Indeed, he probably considered that where such things
could be proved it would be both just and politic to
correct them. His failing to reply on this score, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
seems to have been interpreted by Saint-German
as meaning his rejection of all blame attaching to the
clerical profession in these matters. In the <i>Deballacion
of Salem and Byzance</i>, More protests that this is not his
meaning at all. “He says,” writes he, “that I, in my
mind, prove it to be an intolerable fault in the people
to misjudge the clergy, since I think they have no
cause so to do, and that there I leave them, as if all the
whole cause and principal fault was in the temporality.”
This, More declares he never dreamed of, for “if he
seek these seven years in all my <i>Apology</i>, he shall find
you no such words” to justify this view. On the
contrary, he will find that “I say in those places, ‘that
the people are too reasonable to take this or that thing’
amiss for ‘any reasonable cause of division.’”<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The
fact is, “I have never either laid the principal fault to
the one or to the other.” To much that Saint-German
said, More assented; and his general attitude to the
general accusations he states in these words: “Many
of them I will pass over untouched, both because most
of them are such as every wise man will, I suppose,
answer them himself in the reading, and satisfy his own
mind without any need of my help therein, and because
some things are there also very well said.”</p>

<p>Reading the four books referred to above together,
one is forced to the conviction that the description of
Sir Thomas More really represents the state of the
clergy as it then was. That there were bad as well as
good may be taken for granted, even without the
admissions of More, but that as a body the clergy,
secular or religious, were as hopelessly bad as subsequent
writers have so often asked their readers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
believe, or even that they were as bad as the reports,
started chiefly by Lutheran emissaries, who were
striving to plough up the soil in order to implant the
new German teachings in the place of the old religious
faith of England, would make out, is disproved by the
tracts of both Saint-German and Sir Thomas More. In
such a discussion it may be taken for granted that the
worst would have appeared. Had the former any
evidence of general and hopeless corruption he would,
when pressed by his adversary, have brought it forward.
Had the latter&mdash;whose honesty and full knowledge must
be admitted by all&mdash;any suspicion of what later generations
have been asked to believe as the true picture of
ecclesiastical life in pre-Reformation England, he would
not have dared, even if his irreproachable integrity
would have permitted him, to reject as a caricature
and a libel even Christopher Saint-German’s moderate
picture.</p>

<p>In one particular More categorically denies a charge
made by Tyndale against the clergy in general, and
against the Popes for permitting so deplorable a state of
things in regard to clerical morals. As the charge first
suggested by Tyndale has been repeated very frequently
down to our own time, it is useful to give the evidence
of so unexceptional authority as that of the Lord Chancellor
of England. Tyndale declared that although marriage
was prohibited by ecclesiastical law to the clergy
of the Western Church, the Pope granted leave “unto
as many as bring money” to keep concubines. And
after asserting that this was the case in Germany, Wales,
Ireland, &amp;c., he adds, “And in England thereto they
be not few who have (this) licence&mdash;some of the Pope,
and some of their ordinaries.” To this More says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
“We have had many pardons come hither, and many
dispensations and many licences too, but yet I thank
our Lord I never knew none such, nor I trust never
shall, nor Tyndale, I trow either; but that he listeth
loud to lie. And as for his licences customably given
by the ordinaries, I trust he lies in regard to other
countries, for as for England I am sure he lies.”<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>It would of course be untrue to suggest that there
were no grounds whatever for objection to the clerical
life of the period. At all times the ministers of the
Church of God are but human instruments, manifesting
now more now less the human infirmities of their nature.
A passage in a sermon preached by Bishop Longland of
Lincoln in 1538 suggests that the most crying abuse
among the clergy of that time was simony. “Yet there
is one thing, or ill which the prophet saw not in this
city (of Sodom). What is that? That which specially
above other things should have been seen. What is it?
That which most is abused in this world. I pray thee,
what is it? Make no more ado: tell it. That which
almost destroyed the Church of Christ. Then, I pray
thee, shew it: shew what it is: let it be known, that
remedy may be had and the thing holpen. What is it?
Forsooth it is simony, simony: chapping and changing,
buying and selling of benefices and of spiritual gifts and
promotions. And no better merchandise is nowadays
than to procure advowsons of patrons for benefices, for
prebends, for other spiritual livelihood, whether it be by
suit, request, by letters, by money bargain or otherwise:
yea, whether it be to buy them or to sell them, thou
shalt have merchants plenty, merchants enough for it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<p>“These advowsons are abroad here in this city. In
which city? In most part of all the great cities of this
realm. In the shops, in the streets, a common merchandise.
And they that do come by their benefices or
promotions under such a manner shall never have grace
of God to profit the Church.”<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to recall the fact that the late Mr.
Brewer, whose intimate knowledge of this period of our
national history is admitted on all hands, arrived, after
the fullest investigation, at a similar conclusion as to
the real state of the Church in pre-Reformation England.
Taking first the religious houses, this high authority
considers that no doubt many circumstances had contributed
at this time to lower the tone of religious
discipline; but taking a broad survey, the following is
the historian’s verdict: “That in so large a body of
men, so widely dispersed, seated for so many centuries
in the richest and fairest estates of England, for which
they were mainly indebted to their own skill, perseverance,
and industry, discreditable members were to be
found (and what literary <i>chiffonnier</i>, raking in the
scandalous annals of any profession, cannot find filth
and corruption?) is likely enough, but that the corruption
was either so black or so general as party spirit
would have us believe, is contrary to all analogy, and is
unsupported by impartial and contemporary evidence.”<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>“It is impossible,” he says in another place, “that
the clergy can have been universally immoral and the
laity have remained sound, temperate, and loyal.”
This, by the way, is exactly what More, who lived in
the period, insisted upon.</p>

<p>“But,” continues Brewer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> “if these general arguments
are not sufficient, I refer my readers to a very
curious document, dated the 8th of July 1519, when a
search was instituted by different commissioners on a
Sunday night, in London and its suburbs, for all
suspected and disorderly persons. I fear no parish in
London, nor any town in the United Kingdom, of the
same amount of population, would at this day pass a
similar ordeal with equal credit.”<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> And in another
place he sums up the question in these words: “Considering
the temper of the English people, it is not
probable that immorality could have existed among
the ancient clergy to the degree which the exaggeration
of poets, preachers, and satirists might lead us to
suppose. The existence of such corruption is not
justified by authentic documents or by any impartial
and broad estimate of the character and conduct of the
nation before the Reformation. If these complaints of
preachers and moralists are to be accepted as authoritative
on this head, there would be no difficulty in
producing abundant evidence from the Reformers
themselves that the abuses and enormities of their
own age, under Edward VI. and Elizabeth, were far
greater than in the ages preceding.”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>It is too often assumed that in the choice and
education of the clergy little care and discretion was
exercised by the bishops and other responsible officials,
and that thus those unfit for the sacred ministry by
education and character often found their way into the
priesthood. In the last Convocation held on the eve of
the Reformation a serious attempt was evidently made
to correct whatever abuses existed in this matter, when
it was enacted that no bishop might ordain any subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
not born in his diocese or beneficed in it, or without a
domicile in it for three months, even with dimissorial
letters. Further, that no secular clerk should be ordained
without testimonial letters as to character from the
parish priest of the place where he was born or had
lived for three years, sealed by the archdeacon of the
district, or in the case of a university, by the seal of the
vice-chancellor. No one whatsoever was to be admitted
to the subdiaconate “who was not so versed in the
Epistles and Gospels, at least those contained in the
Missal, as to be able at once to explain their grammatical
meaning to the examiner.” He must also show
that he understands and knows whatever pertains to his
office.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The most important book of this period dealing
with the life and education of the clergy is a tract
printed by Wynkyn de Worde about the beginning of
the sixteenth century. It was written by William de
Melton, Chancellor of York, and at the end is the
declaration of Colet, that he has read it and highly
approves of its contents.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The author states that he
desires to instruct the “many young men” who every
Ember time come up to York for ordination in their
duties. No person, he says, ought to present himself
to receive the priesthood who is not prepared to lead
a life in all things worthy of the sacred ministry.
He should remember that he is really to be accounted
one of the twelve who sat with our Lord at His last
supper. He must be sufficiently versed in the learning
of the world not to dishonour the priestly calling,
and above all be taught in His school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> “who has
said, ‘Learn of Me, for I am meek and humble of
heart.’”</p>

<p>“And since I am now on the question of those only
partly well learned,” continues the author, “I wish
all coming for ordination to understand that always
and everywhere those who have not yet attained to
at least a fair knowledge of good letters are to be
rejected as candidates for Holy Orders. They can
in no way be considered to have a fair knowledge of
letters who, though skilful in grammar, do not possess
the science well enough to read promptly and easily
Latin books, and above all, the sacred Scriptures,
and expound their meaning and the literal signification
of the words as they stand in the books; and
this not haltingly, but readily and easily, so as to show
that they know the language not merely slightly and
slenderly, but that they possess a full and radical
knowledge of it and its construction. Therefore, those
who read the sacred Scriptures or other Latin work
with difficulty, or, whilst reading, often mistake the
proper connection of the words, or read them with
such pauses as to seem not to be used to the Latin
language, are to be refused Sacred Orders until, by
diligent study, they have become more skilled in their
letters.”</p>

<p>In the same way the tract goes on to declare that
those who are unable to explain or understand the
spiritual signification of Scripture are to be refused
ordination to the sacred ministry until they show
themselves at least fairly well able to do so. “To be
reckoned among even the fairly proficient, we require,”
says the author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> “such a thorough and sure foundation
of grammatical knowledge that there may be hopes that
alone and without other teachers they may, from books
and diligent study, endeavour day by day to improve
themselves by reading and study.” Then addressing
the candidates the author begs them, if they feel they
have not this necessary foundation, “not through mere
presumption to offer themselves to the examiners.”
“Seek not a position in the Church of God in which
neither now nor during your whole life will you be
able to show yourself a fitting minister. For those
who before taking Holy Orders have not fitted themselves
fairly well in learning rarely if ever are seen to
make progress in literature. On the contrary, they
ever remain, even to old age, dunces and stupid, and,
furthermore, such priests known to the common people
for such manifest ignorance are a great scandal which
involves the whole sacred ministry.”</p>

<p>Great damage is done to the whole Church of God
through the ignorance of the clergy. Both in towns
and country places there are priests who occupy themselves,
some in mean and servile work, some who give
themselves to tavern drinking; the former can hardly
help mixing themselves up with women, the latter
employ their time in games of dice, &amp;c., and some of
them pass it in the vanities of hunting and hawking.
Thus do they spend their whole lives to extreme old
age in idleness and non-religious occupations. Nor
could they do otherwise, for as they are quite ignorant
of good letters, how can they be expected to work at
and take a pleasure in reading and study; rather
throwing away these despised and neglected books, they
turn to that kind of miserable and unpriestly life described
above, hoping to kill time and cure their dulness
by such things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>He then goes on to exhort the young to implant
in their hearts a strong desire to study deeply in the
books of God’s Law rather than to be tainted thus by
the stains and vanities of the world which they were
supposed to have left. “It is,” he continues, “impossible
that such a holy desire should possess you,
unless you have made progress in such studies before
taking Holy Orders, and are so advanced in your literary
studies that the reading of many books is both easy
and pleasant to you, and the construction of the meaning
of a passage no longer difficult, but whilst reading
you may quickly and easily follow at least the literal
sense of the sentence.”</p>

<p>This interesting tract then goes on to warn subdeacons
not to take upon themselves the perpetual
obligations of Sacred Orders unless they are conscious
to themselves of no reason or objection, however secret
and hidden, which may stand in the way of their faithfully
keeping their promises. They must feel that they
enter the ranks of the clergy only from the motive of
serving God. Then, after warning the clergy against
the vices which specially detract from the sacred character
of the priesthood, the author continues, “Let
us therefore turn to study, reading, and meditation of
the Holy Scriptures as the best remedy against unworthy
sloth and foolish desires. Let us not consume
the time given us uselessly and fruitlessly.” A priest
should say his Hours and Mass daily. He should
spend the morning till mid-day in choir and other
works, and even then not think he has fulfilled the
whole duty of the priesthood. A priest is bound to
serious studies and meditation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> “Constant reading
and meditation of the books of God’s law and the
writings of the holy Fathers and Doctors are the best
remedy for slothful habits,” and these have been put
at the disposition of all through the printing-press.
Just as a workman has besides his shop a workroom
where he has to spend hours preparing the wares that
he offers for sale, so the priest, who in the church on
Sunday offers his people the things necessary for salvation,
should spend days and nights in holy reading and
study in order to make them his own before he hands
them on to others. “Wherefore, my dearest brethren,
let us think ourselves proper priests only when we find
our delight and joy in the constant study of Holy
Scripture.”</p>

<p>So much for the important advice given to priests
or those intending to be priests as to the necessity of
acquiring previous habits of study. Not infrequently
the fact that in 1532 Parliament did actually transfer
the power of ecclesiastical legislation hitherto possessed
by Convocation to the Crown, is adduced as proof that
to the nation at large the powers of the clergy, for a
long time resented, had at length become a yoke not
to be borne. Yet it is clear that the policy of the king
to crush the clergy in this way was by no means heartily
supported by the Commons. There can be no doubt
whatever that the petition of the Commons against the
spirituality really emanated from the Court, and that the
Lower House was compelled by direct royal influence to
take the course indicated by royal will. Four drafts
of the petition existing among the State papers in the
Record Office put this beyond doubt, as they are all
corrected in the well-known hand of Henry’s adviser at
this time, Thomas Cromwell. The substance of the
petition states that on account of the diffusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
heretical books, and the action of the bishops in spiritual
courts, “much discord had arisen between the
clergy and the laity at large.” The answer of the
bishops denies all knowledge of this discord, at least
on their parts. The ordinaries, they said, exercised
spiritual jurisdiction, and no one might interfere in
that, as their right to make laws in this sphere was
from God, and could be proved by Scripture. The
two jurisdictions could not clash as they were derived
from the same source, namely, the authority given by
God. Finally, they practically refused to consider the
possibility of any just royal interference in matters of
the purely ecclesiastical domain. Their resistance was,
of course, as we know, of no avail; but the incident
shows that up to the very eve of the changes the clergy
had no notion of any surrender of their spiritual prerogatives,
and that it was the Crown and not the
Commons that was hostile to them.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">ERASMUS</span></h2>

<p>During the first portion of the sixteenth century
Erasmus occupied a unique position in Europe. He
was beyond question the most remarkable outcome of
the renaissance in its literary aspect; and he may fairly
be taken as a type of the critical attitude of mind in
which many even of the best and the most loyal
Catholics of the day approached the consideration of
the serious religious problems which were, at that time,
forcing themselves upon the notice of the ecclesiastical
authorities. Such men held that the best service a true
son of the Church could give to religion was the service
of a trained mind, ready to face facts as they were, convinced
that the Christian faith had nothing to lose by
the fullest light and the freest investigation, but at the
same time protesting that they would suffer no suspicion
to rest on their entire loyalty of heart to the authority
of the teaching Church.</p>

<p>Keenly alive to the spiritual wants of the age, and
to what he, in common with many others of the time,
considered crying abuses in the government of the
Church, resulting from the excessive temporal grandeur
of ecclesiastics engaged in secular sovereignty and
government, Erasmus, like many of his contemporaries,
is often perhaps injudicious in the manner in which he
advocated reforms. But when the matter is sifted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the bottom, it will commonly be found that his ideas
are just. He clamoured loudly and fearlessly for the
proper enforcing of ecclesiastical discipline, and for a
complete change in the stereotyped modes of teaching;
and he proclaimed the need of a thorough literary
education for Churchmen as the best corrective of what
he held to be the narrowing formalism of mediæval
scholastic training. It is, perhaps, hardly wonderful
that his general attitude in these matters should have
been misunderstood and exaggerated. By many of
his Catholic contemporaries he was looked upon as a
secret rebel against received authority, and in truth as
the real intellectual force of the whole Lutheran movement.
By the Reformers themselves, regarded as at
heart belonging to them, he was upbraided as a coward,
and spoken of as one who had not the courage of his
convictions. Posterity has represented him now in
the one aspect, now in the other, now as at best a
lukewarm Catholic, now as a secret and dangerous
heretic. By most Catholics probably he has been
regarded as a Reformer, as pronounced even as Luther
himself; or to use the familiar phrase founded upon an
expression of his own, they considered that “his was
the egg which Luther hatched.” Few writers have
endeavoured to read any meaning into his seemingly
paradoxical position by reference to his own explanations,
or by viewing it in the light of the peculiar circumstances
of the times in which he lived, and which
are, to some extent at least, responsible for it.</p>

<p>Desiderius Erasmus was born at Rotterdam, in the
year 1467. His father’s Christian name was Gerhard,
of which Desiderius was intended for the Latin, and
Erasmus for the Greek, equivalent. Other surname he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
had none, as he was born out of wedlock; but his
father adopted the responsibility of his education, for
which he provided by placing him first as a chorister in
the cathedral of Utrecht, and subsequently by sending
him to Deventer, then one of the best schools in
Northern Europe. Deventer was at that time presided
over by the learned scholar and teacher Alexander
Hegius, and amongst his fellow-students there, Erasmus
found several youths who subsequently, as men, won
for themselves renown in the learned world. One of
them, under the title of Adrian VI., subsequently occupied
the Papal chair.</p>

<p>His father and mother both died of the plague
whilst Erasmus was still young. At the age of thirteen
he was taken from Deventer by the three guardians to
whose charge he had been committed, and sent to a
purely ecclesiastical school, meant to prepare those
intended only for a life in the cloister. Here he
remained for three years, and after having for a considerable
time resisted the suggestions of his masters
that he should join their Order, he finally entered the
novitiate of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine at
Stein, near Gouda. Here he was professed at the age
of nineteen, and after the usual interval was ordained
priest.</p>

<p>Much obscurity and many apparent contradictions
prevent us fully understanding Erasmus’s early life, and
in particular the portion spent by him in the cloister.
One thing, however, would seem to be quite clear; he
could never have had any vocation for the religious life.
His whole subsequent history shows this unmistakeably;
and the ill-judged zeal of those who practically forced
him into a state for which he was constitutionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
unfitted, and for which he had no aptitude or
inclination, must, if we take his account of the facts
as correct, be as strongly condemned by all right-thinking
people as by himself. He, however, appears
not to have understood that this may have been a
special case, and not the usual lot of youths entering
religion. One evident result of his experience is the
bitter feeling created in his heart towards the religious
Orders and the uncompromising hostility he ever after
displayed towards them. In the celebrated letter he
wrote to the papal secretary, Lambert Grunnius, which
was intended for the information of the Pope himself,
and which is supposed to describe his own case,
Erasmus justly condemns in the strongest language the
practice of enticing youths into the cloister before they
were fully aware of what they were doing. If we
are to believe the statements made in that letter,
Erasmus did not think that his was by any means
a singular case. Agents of the religious Orders, he
declared, were ever hanging about the schools and
colleges, endeavouring to entice the youthful students
into their ranks by any and every method. But he
is careful to add,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> “I do not condemn the religious
Orders as such. I do not approve of those who make
the plunge and then fly back to liberty as a licence for
loose living, and desert improperly what they undertook
foolishly. But dispositions vary; all things do not suit
all characters, and no worse misfortune can befall a
youth of intellect than to be buried under conditions from
which he can never after extricate himself. The world
thought well of my schoolmaster guardian because he
was neither a liar nor a scamp nor a gambler, but
he was coarse, avaricious, and ignorant, he knew
nothing beyond the confused lessons he taught to his
classes. He imagined that in forcing a youth to
become a monk he would be offering a sacrifice
acceptable to God. He used to boast of the many
victims which he destined to Dominic and Francis and
Benedict.”<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Without any taste for the routine of conventual
life, and with his mind filled by an ardent love of
letters, which there seemed in the narrow circle of
his cloister no prospect of ever being able to gratify,
the short period of Erasmus’s stay at Stein must have
been to him in the last degree uncongenial and irksome.
Fortunately, however, for his own peace of mind and
for the cause of general learning, a means was quickly
found by which he was practically emancipated from
the restraints he ought never to have undertaken.
The Bishop of Cambray obtained permission to have
him as secretary, and after keeping him a short time
in this position he enabled him to proceed to the
University of Paris. From this time Erasmus was
practically released from the obligations of conventual
life; and in 1514, when some question had been
raised about his return to the cloister, he readily
obtained from the Pope a final release from a form
of life for which obviously he was constitutionally
unfitted, and the dress of which he had been permitted
to lay aside seven years previously.</p>

<p>The generosity of his episcopal patron did not
suffice to meet all Erasmus’s wants. To add to his
income he took pupils, and with one of them, Lord
Mountjoy, he came to England in 1497. He spent,
apparently, the next three years at Oxford, living in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the house which his Order had at that University;
whilst there he made the acquaintance of the most
learned Englishmen of that time, and amongst others
of Grocyn, Linacre, and Colet. He also at this time
took up the study of the Greek language, with which
previously he had but a slender acquaintance, and
his ardour was so great that the following year, 1498,
whilst at work on the <i>Adagia</i>, he could write, “I am
giving my whole soul to the study of Greek; directly
I get some money I shall buy Greek authors first,
and then some clothes.” From 1499 to 1506 he was
continually moving about in various learned centres
of France and Holland, his longest stay being at the
University of Louvain.</p>

<p>In the April of 1506 he was again in England, first
with Archbishop Warham and Sir Thomas More in
London, and subsequently at Cambridge; but in a few
months he was enabled to carry out the plan of visiting
Italy which he had long contemplated. He engaged to
escort the two sons of Sebastian Boyer, the English
court physician, as far as Bologna, and by September
he was already in Turin, where he took his doctor’s
degree in divinity. The winter of the same year he
passed at Bologna, and reached Venice in the spring
of 1507.</p>

<p>His main object in directing his steps to this last-named
city was to pass the second and enlarged edition
of his <i>Adagia</i> through the celebrated Aldine printing-press.
Here he found gathered together, within reach
of the press, a circle of illustrious scholars. Aldus himself,
a man, as Erasmus recalled in a letter written in
1524,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> “approaching the age of seventy years, but in
all matters relating to letters still in the prime of his
youth,” was his host. In 1508 Erasmus removed to
Padua, and the following year passed on to Rome,
where he was well received. His stay in the eternal
city at this time was not prolonged, for a letter received
from Lord Mountjoy announcing the death of
Henry VII., and the good affection of his youthful
successor to learning, determined him to turn his face
once more towards England. He had left the country
with keen regret, for, as he wrote to Dean Colet, “I
can truly say that no place in the world has given me
so many friends&mdash;true, learned, helpful, and illustrious
friends&mdash;as the single city of London,” and he looked
forward to his return with pleasurable expectation.</p>

<p>For a brief period on his arrival again in this
country Erasmus stayed in London at the house of
Sir Thomas More, where, at his suggestion, he wrote
the <i>Enconium Moriæ</i>, one of the works by which he is
best known to the general reader, and the one, perhaps,
the spirit of which has the most given rise to many
mistaken notions as to the author’s religious convictions.</p>

<p>From London, in 1510, he was invited by Bishop
Fisher to come and teach at Cambridge, where by his
influence he had been appointed Lady Margaret Professor
of Divinity and Regius Reader of Greek. “Unless
I am much mistaken,” Erasmus writes, “the Bishop of
Rochester is a man without an equal at this time, both
as to integrity of life, learning, or broad-minded sympathies.
One only do I except, as a very Achilles, the
Archbishop of Canterbury (Warham), who alone keeps
me in London, though I confess not very unwillingly.”<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>In estimating the spirit which dictated the composition
of the <i>Moriæ</i>, it is well to remember not only that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
it represented almost as much the thought and genius
of Sir Thomas More as of Erasmus himself, but that,
at the very time it was taking definite shape in More’s
house at Chelsea, the author’s two best friends were the
two great and devout churchmen, Archbishop Warham
and the saintly Bishop Fisher. Moreover, Sir Thomas
More himself denies that to this work of Erasmus there
can justly be affixed the note of irreverence or irreligion;
he answers for the good intention of the author, and
accepts his own share of responsibility for the publication
of the book.</p>

<p>The period of Erasmus’s stay at Cambridge did not
extend beyond three years. The stipend attached to
his professorships was not large, and Erasmus was still,
apparently, in constant want of money. Archbishop
Warham continued his friend, and by every means
tried continually to interest others directly in the cause
of learning and indirectly in the support of Erasmus,
who is ever complaining that his means are wholly
inadequate to supply his wants. The scholar, however,
remained on the best of terms with all the chief English
churchmen of the day, until, as he wrote to the Abbot
of St. Bertin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> “Erasmus has been almost transformed
into an Englishman, with such overwhelming kindness
do so many treat me, and above all, my special Mæcenas,
the Archbishop of Canterbury. He indeed is not only
my patron, but that of all the learned, amongst whom I
but hold a low place. Immortal gods! how pleasant,
how ready, how fertile is the wit of that man! What
dexterity does he not show in managing the most complicated
business! What exceptional learning! What
singular courtesy does he not extend to all! What
gaiety and geniality at interviews! so that he never
sends people away from him sad. Added to this, how
great and how prompt is his liberality! He alone
seems to be ignorant of his own great qualities and the
height of his dignity and fortune. No one can be more
true and faithful to his friends; and, in a word, he is
truly a Primate, not only in dignity, but in everything
worthy of praise.”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus returns to this same subject in writing to
a Roman Cardinal about this time. When I think, he
says, of the Italian sky, the rich libraries, and the
society of the learned men in Rome, I am tempted to
look back to the eternal city with regret. “But the
wonderful kindness of William Warham, Archbishop
of Canterbury, to me mitigates my desire to return.
Had he been my father or brother he could not have
been more kind and loving. I have been accorded,
too, the same reception by many other bishops of
England. Amongst these stands pre-eminent the
Bishop of Rochester, a man who, in addition to
his uprightness of life, is possessed of deep and varied
learning, and of a soul above all meanness, for which
gifts he is held here in England in the highest estimation.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus certainly had reason to be grateful to
Warham and his other English friends for their ready
attention to his, at times importunate, requests. Warham,
he writes at one time, “has given me a living
worth a hundred nobles and changed it at my request
into a pension of one hundred crowns. Within these
few years he has given me more than four hundred
nobles without my asking. One day he gave me one
hundred and fifty. From other bishops I have received
more than one hundred, and Lord Mountjoy
has secured me a pension of one hundred crowns.” In
fact, in the <i>Compendium Vitæ</i>, a few years later, he says
that he would have remained for the rest of his life
in England had the promises made to him been always
fulfilled. This constant and importunate begging on
the part of the great scholar forms certainly an unpleasant
feature in his life. He gets from Dean Colet
fifteen angels for a dedication, and in reference to
his translation of St. Basil on the Prophet Isaias,
begs Colet to find out whether Bishop Fisher will
be inclined “to ease his labours with a little reward,”
adding himself, “O this begging! I know well
enough that you will be laughing at me.”<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Again,
whilst lamenting his poverty and his being compelled
to beg continually in this way, he adds that Linacre
has been lecturing him for thus pestering his friends,
and has warned him to spare Archbishop Warham and
his friend Mountjoy a little. In this same letter,
written in October 1513, there are signs of friction
with some of the Cambridge teachers of theology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
which may have helped Erasmus in his determination
once more to leave England. Not that he professed
to care what people thought, for he tells Colet he does
not worry about those whom he calls in derision “the
Scotists,” but would treat them as he would a wasp.
Nevertheless, he is still half inclined by the opposition
to stop the work he is engaged on; confessing,
also, that he is almost turned away from the design
of thus translating St. Basil, as the Bishop of Rochester
is not anxious for him to do it, and&mdash;at least so
a friend has told him&mdash;rather suspects that he is
translating, not from the original Greek, but is making
use of a Latin version.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after writing this letter Erasmus
again bade farewell to England, and passed up the
Rhine to Strasburg, where he made the acquaintance of
Wimpheling, Sebastian Brant, and others. The following
year, 1515, he went on to Basle, attracted by the
great reputation of the printing-press set up in that city
by Froben. He was there eagerly welcomed by the
bishop of the city, who had gathered round him many
men imbued with the true spirit of learning; and Erasmus
soon became the centre of this brilliant group of
scholars. From this time Basle became Erasmus’s
home, although, especially in the early years, he was
always on the move. He paid a flying visit once
more, in 1517, to England, but he had learnt to love
his independence too much to entertain any proposals
for again undertaking duties that would tie him to any
definite work in any definite place. Even the suggestions
of friends that he would find congenial and
profitable pursuits in England were unheeded, and
he remained unmoved even when his friend Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Ammonius wrote to say the king himself was looking
for his return. “What about Erasmus?” Henry
had asked. “When is he coming back to us? He
is the light of our age. Oh that he would return
to us!”<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>From England, however, he continued to receive supplies
of money; although his circumstances improved
so much with the steady circulation of his books, that
he was not at this second period of his life so dependent
upon the charity of his friends. About the year
1520 Erasmus settled permanently at Basle as literary
superintendent of Froben’s press. What, no doubt,
induced him to do so, even more than the offer of this
position, was the fact that Basle had then become, by
the establishment of printing-presses by Amberbach
and Froben, the centre of the German book-trade.
Froben died in 1527, and that circumstance, as well
as the religious troubles which, separating Basle from
the empire and making it the focus of civil strife,
ended in wrecking learning there altogether, put an end
to Erasmus’s connection with the press which for
eight years had taken the lead of all the presses of
Europe. Not only was the literary superintendence
of the work completely in the hands of Erasmus
during this period which he described as his “mill,”
but all the dedications and prefaces to Froben’s editions
of the Fathers were the distinct work of his own
pen. His literary activity at this period was enormous,
and only the power he had acquired of working with
the greatest rapidity could have enabled him to cope
with the multiplicity of demands made upon him.
Scaliger relates that Aldus informed him Erasmus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
could do twice as much work in a given time as any
other man he had ever met. This untiring energy
enabled him to cope with the immense correspondence
which, as he says, came pouring in “daily from almost
all parts, from kings, princes, prelates, men of learning,
and even from persons of whose existence I was, till
then, ignorant,” and caused him not infrequently to write
as many as forty letters a day.</p>

<p>On Froben’s death in 1527, the fanatical religious
contentions forced him to remove to Freiburg, in Breisgau,
where he resided from 1529 to 1535. The need
for seeing his <i>Ecclesiastes</i> through the press, as well as
a desire to revisit the scenes of his former activity, took
him back to Basle; but his health had been giving way
for some years, and, at the age of sixty-nine, he expired
at Basle on July 12, 1536.</p>

<p>Such is a brief outline of the life of the most
remarkable among the leaders of the movement known
as the renaissance of letters. Without some general
knowledge of the main facts of his life and work, it
would be still more difficult than it is to understand
the position he took in regard to the great religious
revolution during the later half of his life. With these
main facts before us we may turn to a consideration of
his mental attitude towards some of the many momentous
questions which were then searching men’s hearts
and troubling their souls.</p>

<p>In the first place, of course, comes the important
problem of Erasmus’s real position as regards the
Church itself and its authority. That he was outspoken
on many points, even on points which we now
regard as well within the border-line of settled matters
of faith and practice, may be at once admitted, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
he never appears to have wavered in his determination
at all costs to remain true and loyal to the Pope and
the other constituted ecclesiastical authorities. The
open criticism of time-worn institutions in which he
indulged, and the sweeping condemnation of the ordinary
teachings of the theological schools, which he
never sought to disguise, brought him early in his
public life into fierce antagonism with many devoted
believers in the system then in vogue.</p>

<p>The publication of his translation of the New Testament
from the Greek brought matters to an issue. The
general feeling in England and amongst those best able
to judge had been favourable to the undertaking, and
on its first appearance Erasmus was assured of the
approval of the learned world at the English universities.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
More wrote Latin verses addressed to the
reader of the new translation, calling it “the holy work
and labour of the learned and immortal Erasmus,” to
purify the text of God’s Word. Colet was warm in
its praises. Copies, he writes to Erasmus, are being
readily bought and read. Many approved, although,
of course, as was to be expected, some spoke against
the undertaking. In England, as elsewhere, says Colet,
“we have theologians such as you describe in your
<i>Moriæ</i>, by whom to be praised is dishonour, to be
blamed is the highest praise.” For his part, Colet has,
he says, only one regret that he did not himself know
Greek sufficiently well to be able fully to appreciate
what Erasmus had done, though “he is only too thankful
for the light that has been thrown upon the true
meaning of the Holy Scripture.” Archbishop Warham
writes what is almost an official letter, to tell Erasmus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
that his edition of the New Testament has been welcomed
by all his brother bishops in England to whom
he has shown it. Bishop Tunstall was away in Holland,
where, amidst the insanitary condition of the islands
of Zeeland, which he so graphically describes, he finds
consolation in the study of the work. He cannot too
highly praise it&mdash;not merely as the opening up of
Greek sources of information upon the meaning of
the Bible, but as affording the fullest commentary on
the sacred text.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Bishop Fisher was equally clear as
to the service rendered to religion by Erasmus in this
version of the Testament; and when, in 1519, Froben
had agreed to bring out a second edition, Erasmus
turned to Fisher and More to assist in making the
necessary corrections.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>More defended his friend most strenuously. Writing
to Marten Dorpius in 1515, he upbraided him with
suggesting that theologians would never welcome the
help afforded to biblical studies by Erasmus’s work on
the Greek text of the Bible. He ridicules as a joke not
meriting a serious reply the report that Erasmus and
his friends had declared there was no need of the theologians
and philosophers, but that grammar would
suffice. Erasmus, who has studied in the universities
of Paris, Padua, Bologna, and Rome, and taught with
distinction in some of them, is not likely to hold such
absurd ideas. At the same time, More does not hesitate
to say that in many things he thinks some theologians
are to be blamed, especially those who, rejecting all
positive science, hold that man is born to dispute about
questions of all kinds which have not the least practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
utility “even as regards the <i>pietas fidei</i> or the cultivation
of sound morals.”</p>

<p>At great length More defends the translation against
the insinuations made by Dorpius, who evidently regarded
it as a sacrilege to suggest that the old Latin
editions in use in the Church were incorrect. St.
Jerome, says More, did not hesitate to change when
he believed the Latin to be wrong, and Dorpius’s suggestion
that Erasmus should have only noted the errors
and not actually made any change would, had the
same principle been applied, have prevented St. Jerome’s
work altogether. If it was thought proper that the
Latin codices should be corrected at that time by
Greek manuscripts, why not now? The Church had then
an equally recognised version before the corrections of
St. Jerome.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>There were, indeed, as might be expected, some
discordant notes in the general chorus of English
praise. For the time, however, they remained unheeded,
and, in fact, were hardly heard amid the general
verdict of approval, in which the Pope, cardinals, and
other highly-placed ecclesiastics joined. Erasmus,
however, was fully prepared for opposition of a serious
character. Writing to Cambridge at the time, he says
that he knows what numbers of people prefer “their
old <i>mumpsimus</i> to the new <i>sumpsimus</i>,” and condemn
the undertaking on the plea that no such work as
the correction of the text of Holy Scripture ought
to be undertaken without the authority of a general
Council.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to understand the grounds upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
men who had been trained on old methods looked
with anxiety, and even horror, at this new departure.
Scholarship and literary criticism, when applied to the
pagan classics, might be tolerable enough; but what
would be the result were the same methods to be
used in the examination of the works of the Fathers,
and more especially in criticism of the text of the Holy
Scripture itself? Overmuch study of the writings of
ancient Greece and Rome had, it appeared to many,
in those days, hardly tended to make the world much
better: even in high places pagan models had been
allowed to displace ideals and sentiments, which, if barbarous
and homely, were yet Christian. Theologians
had long been accustomed to look upon the Latin Vulgate
text as almost sacrosanct, and after the failure of the
attempt in the thirteenth century to improve and correct
the received version, no critical revision had been dreamt
of as possible, or indeed considered advisable. Those
best able to judge, such as Warham and More and
Fisher, were not more eager to welcome, than others
to condemn and ban, this attempt on the part of
Erasmus to apply the now established methods of
criticism to the sacred text. Not that the edition
itself was in reality a work of either sound learning
or thorough scholarship. As an edition of the Greek
Testament it is now allowed on all hands to have no
value whatever; but the truth is, that the Greek played
only a subordinate part in Erasmus’s scheme. His
principal object was to produce a new Latin version,
and to justify this he printed the Greek text along
with it. And this, though in itself possessing little
critical value, was, in reality, the starting-point for all
modern Biblical criticism. As a modern writer has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
said, “Erasmus did nothing to solve the problem,
but to him belongs the honour of having first propounded
it.”</p>

<p>It must, however, be borne in mind that the publication
of Erasmus’s New Testament was not, as is
claimed for it by some modern writers, a new revelation
of the Gospel to the world at large, nor is it
true that the sacred text had become so obscured by
scholastic theological disquisitions on side issues as
almost to be forgotten. According to Mr. Froude,
“the New Testament to the mass of Christians was an
unknown book,” when Erasmus’s edition, which was
multiplied and spread all over Europe, changed all this.
Pious and ignorant men had come to look on the text
of the Vulgate as inspired. “Read it intelligently they
could not, but they had made the language into an
idol, and they were filled with horrified amazement
when they found in page after page that Erasmus had
anticipated modern critical corrections of the text, introduced
various readings, and re-translated passages
from the Greek into a new version.”<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The truth is
that the publication of the New Testament was in no
sense an appeal <i>ad populum</i>, but to the cultivated few.
A writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, commenting upon
Mr. Froude’s picture of the effect of the new edition
on the people generally, is by no means unjust when
he says, “Erasmus beyond all question would have
been very much astonished by this account of the
matter. Certain it is that during the Middle Ages the
minds of the most popular preachers and teachers
(and we might add of the laity too) were saturated
with the sacred Scriptures.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Loud, however, was the outcry in many quarters
against the rash author. His translations were glibly
condemned, and it was pointed out as conclusive
evidence of his heterodoxy that he had actually
changed some words in the Our Father, and substituted
the word <i>congregatio</i> for <i>ecclesia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The year 1519 witnessed the most virulent and
persistent attacks upon the good name of Erasmus.
Of these, and the malicious reports being spread
about him, he complains in numerous letters at this
period. One Englishman in particular at this time,
and subsequently, devoted all his energies to prove
not only that Erasmus had falsified many of his translations,
but that his whole spirit in undertaking the
work was manifestly uncatholic. This was Edward
Lee, then a comparatively unknown youth, but who
was subsequently created Archbishop of York. In February
1519, Erasmus wrote to Cardinal Wolsey, complaining
of these continued attacks upon his work,
although so many learned men, including bishops,
cardinals, and even the Pope Leo X. himself, had given
their cordial approval to the undertaking. Those who
were at the bottom of the movement against the work, he
considered, were those who had not read it, though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
still had no shame in crying out against it and its author.
He was told that in some public discourses in England
he had been blamed for translating the word <i>verbum</i> in
St. John’s Gospel by <i>sermo</i>, and about this matter he
addressed a letter to the Pope defending himself.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> To
the Bishop of Winchester he wrote more explicitly about
his chief opponent. “By your love for me,” he says, “I
beg you will not too readily credit those sycophants about
me, for by their action all things seem to me at present
infected by a deadly plague. If Edward Lee can prove
that he knows better than I do, he will never offend me.
But when he, by writing and speech, and by means of
his followers, spreads rumours hurtful to my reputation,
he is not even rightly consulting his own reputation.
He has openly shown a hostile spirit against me, who
never, either in word or deed, have done him harm.
He is young, and lusts for fame.… Time will bring
all to light. Truth may be obscured; overcome it
cannot be.”<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> To the English king he writes that in
all he had published he had been actuated by the sole
desire to glorify Christ, and in this particular work had
obtained the highest approval, even that of the Pope
himself. Some people, indeed, have conspired to destroy
his good name. They are so pleased with their
“old wine,” that “Erasmus’s new” does not satisfy
them. Edward Lee had been instigated to become
their champion, and Erasmus only wished that Lee
were not an Englishman, since he owed more to England
than to any other nation, and did not like to think
ill even of an individual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>When men are thoroughly alarmed, they do not
stop to reason or count the cost; and so those, who
saw in the work of Erasmus nothing but danger to
the Church, at once jumped to the conclusion that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
root of the danger really lay in the classical revival
itself, of which he was regarded as the chief exponent
and apostle. The evil must be attacked in its cause,
and the spread of the canker, which threatened to eat
into the body of the Christian Church, stayed before it
was too late. From the theologians of Louvain, with
which university Erasmus was then connected, he
experienced the earliest and most uncompromising
opposition. He was “daily,” to use his own words,
“pounded with stones,” and proclaimed a traitor to
the Church.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> His opponents did not stop to inquire
into the truth of their charges too strictly, and Erasmus
bitterly complains of the damaging reports that are
being spread all over Europe concerning his good
name and his loyalty to religion. To him all opposition
came from “the monks,” who were, in his eyes,
typical of antiquated ecclesiastical narrowness and
bigotry. In a letter written in 1519, at the height
of “the battle of the languages,” as it was called, he
gives several instances of this attitude towards himself
at Louvain when he suggested some alteration in a text
of Holy Scripture. A preacher told the people that
he had declared the Gospel “to be merely a collection
of stupid fables,” and at Antwerp, a Carmelite attacked
him in a sermon, at which he happened to be present,
and denounced the appearance of his New Testament
as a sign of the coming of Antichrist. On being asked
afterwards for his reasons, he confessed that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
never even read the book himself. “This,” says
Erasmus sadly, “I generally find to be the case: that
none are more bitter in their outcry than they who
do not read what I write.” In this same letter, Erasmus
describes the ferment raised in England against the
study of languages. At Cambridge, Greek was making
progress in peace, “because the university was presided
over by John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, a
theologian of learning and uprightness of life.” At
Oxford, however, fierce public attacks were made in
sermons on Greek studies; “but the king,” continues
Erasmus, “as one not unlearned himself, and most
favourable to the cause of letters, happened to be in
the neighbourhood, and hearing of the matter from
More and Pace, ordered that all wishing to study
Greek literature should be encouraged, and so put a
stop to the business.”</p>

<p>The contest was not confined to the schools.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> “A
theologian preaching in the royal palace before the
king took this opportunity to inveigh boldly and uncompromisingly
against Greek studies and the new
methods of interpretation. Pace, who was present,
glanced at the king to see how he took it, and Henry
smiled at Pace. After the sermon the theologian was
bidden to the king, and to More was assigned the task
of defending Greek learning against him, the king himself
desiring to be present at the discussion. After
More had spoken for some time most happily, he
paused to hear the theologian’s reply; but he, on
bended knees, asked pardon for what he had said,
asserting that whilst talking he was moved by some
spirit to speak about Greek as he had done. Thereupon
the king said, ‘And that spirit was not that of
Christ, but of folly!’ Then Henry asked him whether
he had read Erasmus’s works&mdash;he admitted that he had
not. Then said the king, ‘By this you prove your
folly, in condemning what you have not read.’ Finally
the king dismissed him, and ordered that he should
never be allowed to preach in the royal presence
again.”</p>

<p>Those who desired to carry on the campaign to
extremities, endeavoured, and even with temporary
success, to influence Queen Katherine against Erasmus
and the party for the revival of letters which he represented.
Her confessor, a Dominican bishop, persuaded
her that in correcting St. Jerome, Erasmus had perpetrated
a crime which admitted of no excuse.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> It was
but another step to connect the renaissance of letters
generally with the revolt now associated with the name
of Luther. In England, however, it was not so easy
to persuade people of this, since, among the chief
supporters of the movement were to be numbered the
best and wisest of churchmen and laymen whose entire
orthodoxy was not open to suspicion. Abroad, however,
the cry once started, was quickly taken up. A
theologian at Louvain, writes Erasmus, who up to this
time had been noted for his sober judgment, before
a large audience, after having spoken of Lutheranism,
attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> “the teaching of languages and polite letters,
joining the two together, and asserting that heresy
came from these springs, as if experience had shown
eloquence to be a mark rather of the heretics than
of the orthodox, or that the Latin authors of heresy
were not mere children so far as languages went, or
that Luther had been schooled by those masters and
not rather by the scholastics, according to scholastic
methods.”<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus puts the position even more clearly in a
letter to Pope Leo X. on the publication of the revised
version of his New Testament in August 1519. The
book is now in people’s hands, he says, and as it has
appeared under the direct auspices of the Holy Father
himself, it may be regarded as his work. Some foolish
people, he understands, have been trying to get the
Pope to believe that a knowledge of languages is
detrimental to the true study of theology, whereas, in
reality, the very contrary is obviously the case. Such
people will not reason, they cry out and will not listen.
They suggest damning words, such words for example
as “heretics,” “antichrists,” &amp;c., as appropriate to their
opponents. They call out that even the Christian
religion is imperilled, and beg the Pope to come forward
and save it. On his part Erasmus hopes that
the Pope will believe that all his work is for Christ
alone, and His Church. “This only reward do I
desire, that I may ever seek the glory of Christ rather
than my own. From boyhood I have ever endeavoured
to write nothing that savoured of impiety or disloyalty.
No one has ever yet been made blacker by my writings;
no one less pious, no one stirred up to tumult.”<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
Again, writing to Cardinal Campeggio, when sending
him a copy of the New Testament “which Pope Leo
had approved by his Brief,” Erasmus tells him that,
to his great regret, many at Louvain were doing their
best not to allow good letters to flourish. As for himself,
his only real desire was to serve Christ and increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the glory of His Church; though, he adds, “I am a
man, and as such liable to err.” No one has ever
succeeded in pleasing every one, and he, Erasmus, will
not try to do the impossible. Still he wishes to be
judged by what he really has said and written; whereas
all kinds of things, letters, books, &amp;c., are attributed to
him, about which he knows nothing: “even Martin
Luther’s work, amongst the rest,” whilst the truth is,
he does not know Luther, and certainly has never
read his book.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>At the end of the following year, 1520, Erasmus
again writes to Cardinal Campeggio at great length.
After telling him that he had hoped to have passed
the winter in Rome to search in the libraries for Greek
manuscripts, he informs him that in Louvain those who
prefer the old barbarism are now rampant. Some
think to please the people by opposition to learning,
and amongst the aiders and abettors of the Lutheran
movement they place Erasmus in the forefront. The
Dominicans and Carmelites, he says, will regard him
only as their enemy. Why, he does not know, for in
reality he reverences true religion under “any coloured
coat.” If on occasion he has said something about the
vices of the monks, he does not think it were more
right for the religious, as a body, to turn against him,
than it would be for priests as a body, when their vices
were spoken against. He does not in the least wish to
be thought opposed to the religious life, as such. The
condemnation of Luther had been interpreted by many
as a condemnation of learning, and had been turned
against Reuchlin and Erasmus. As for himself, he has
never, he declares, even seen Luther, who has certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
never been famous for good letters or for any knowledge
of ancient tongues, and hence the revival of letters has
no connection whatever with the Lutheran movement.
The prefaces of some of Luther’s books, because written
in good Latin, are considered sufficient proof of his
(Erasmus’s) connection with the matter, and it is
asserted openly that he was working cordially with
the Reformer; whereas, as a fact, he had not suggested
even so much as a full stop or comma for his writings.
He had, he admitted, written to Luther, and this and
another letter to the Cardinal of Mentz were pointed
to as proof positive of his Lutheran leanings. For
these he has been denounced to bishops as a heretic
and delated to the Pope himself, while all the time,
in truth, he has never read two pages of Luther’s
writings. Certainly, indeed, he recognised in Luther
considerable power, but he was not by any means alone
in doing so. Men of undoubted faith and uprightness
had congratulated themselves on having fallen in with
Luther’s works. For himself, he adds, “I have always
preferred to look for the good rather than to search for
the evil, and I have long thought that the world needed
many changes.” Finally, before passing from the
subject, he begs Cardinal Campeggio to look at the
letter in question himself, and see whether it could
justly be said to favour Luther in any way.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>To Pope Leo X. Erasmus also wrote, protesting
against the cause of letters generally being made the
same as that of Reuchlin and Luther. With the former
movement he was identified heart and soul; with Luther
and his revolt he had, he declared, no part nor sympathy.
“I have not known Luther,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> “nor
have I ever read his books, except perhaps ten or a
dozen pages in various places. It was really I who
first scented the danger of the business issuing in
tumults, which I have always detested.” Moreover,
he declares that he had induced the Basle printer,
Johann Froben, to refuse to print Luther’s works, and
that by means of friends he had tried to induce Luther
to think only of the peace of the Church. Two years
previously, he says, Luther had written to him, and he
had replied in a kindly spirit in order to get him, if
possible, to follow his advice. Now, he hears, that this
letter has been delated to the Pope in order to prejudice
him in the Pontiff’s eyes; but he is quite prepared
to defend its form and expression. “If any
one,” he says, “can say he has ever heard me, even at
the table, maintain the teaching of Luther, I will not
refuse to be called a Lutheran.” Finally, he expresses
the hope that, if the opponents of letters have been
trying to calumniate him, he may rely on the Pope’s
prudence and the knowledge of his own complete
innocence. “I, who do not wish to oppose even my
own bishop, am not,” he writes, “so mad as to act in
any way against the supreme Vicar of Christ.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>As time went on, the position of Erasmus did not
become more comfortable. Whilst the Lutherans were
hoping that sooner or later something would happen to
compromise the outspoken scholar and force him to
transfer the weight of his learning to their side, the
champions of Catholicity were ill satisfied that he did
not boldly strike out in defence of the Church. To
this latter course many of his English friends had
strongly urged him, and both the king, Fisher, and
others had set him an example by publishing works
against Luther’s position, which they invited him to
follow. The Pope, too, had on more than one occasion
personally appealed to him to throw off his reserve and
come to the aid of orthodoxy. They could not understand
how he was able to talk of peace and kindness
amidst the din of strife, and plead for less harsh
measures and less bitter words against Luther and his
adherents, when the battle was raging, and cities and
peoples and even countries were being seduced by the
German Reformer’s plausible plea for freedom and
liberty. Those who believed in Erasmus’s orthodoxy,
as did the Pope and his English friends, considered
that no voice was more calculated to calm the storm
and compel the German people to listen to reason than
was his. Whilst the Reforming party, on the other
hand, were doing their best to compromise him in the
eyes of their opponents, Erasmus was most unwilling
to be forced into action. “Why,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> “do
people wish to associate me with Luther? What
Luther thinks of me, where it is a question of matters
of faith, I care very little. That he doesn’t think much
of me he shows in many letters to his friends. In his
opinion I am ‘blind,’ ‘miserable,’ ‘ignorant of Christ
and Christianity,’ ‘thinking of nothing but letters.’
This is just what I should expect,” he says, “for Luther
has always despised the ancients.” As for himself, he
(Erasmus) has always tried his best to inculcate true
piety along with learning.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>To Œcolampadius, in February 1525, he wrote a
letter of protest against the way some of Luther’s
followers were doing all they could to associate his
name with their movement. He does not wish, he
says, to give his own opinion on the questions at issue;
but he can tell his correspondent what the King of
England, Bishop Fisher, and Cardinal Wolsey think
on these grave matters. He objects to Œcolampadius
putting <i>Magnus Erasmus noster</i>&mdash;“our great Erasmus”&mdash;in
a preface he wrote, without any justification. “This
naturally makes people suppose,” he adds, “that I am
really on your side in these controversies,” and he begs
that he will strike out the expression.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>This was no new position that Erasmus had taken
up in view of the ever-increasing difficulties of the
situation. Six years before (in 1519) he had written
fully on the subject to the Cardinal Archbishop of
Mentz. It was this letter which had been much misunderstood,
and even denounced to the Pope as the
work of a disloyal son of the Church. He, on the
other hand, declared that he was not committed in
any way to the cause of Reuchlin or Luther.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> “Luther
is perfectly unknown to me, and his books I have
not read, except here and there. If he had written
well it would not have been to my credit; if then the
opposite, no blame should attach to me. I regretted
his public action, and when the first tract, I forget
which, was talked about, I did all I could to prevent its
being issued, especially as I feared that tumults would
come out of all this. Luther had written me what
appeared to my mind to be a very Christian letter,
and, in replying, I, by the way, warned him not to write
anything seditious, nor to abuse the Roman Pontiff, &amp;c.,
but to preach the Gospel truly and humbly.” He adds
that he was kind in his reply purposely, as he did not
wish to be Luther’s judge. And, as he thought that
there was much good in the man, he would willingly do
all he could to keep him in the right way. People are
too fond, he says, of crying out “heretic,” &amp;c., and
“the cry generally comes from those who have not read
the works they exclaim against.”<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>“I greatly fear,” he writes shortly after, “for this
miserable Luther; so angry are his opponents on all
sides, and so irritated against him are princes, and,
above all, Pope Leo. Would that he had taken my
advice and abstained from these hateful and seditious
publications. There would have been more fruit and
less rancour.”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Testimonies might be multiplied almost indefinitely
from Erasmus’s writings to show that with Lutheranism
as such he had no connection nor sympathy. Yet
his best friends seem to have doubted him, and
some, in England, suspected that Erasmus’s hand
and spirit were to be detected in the reply that
Luther made to King Henry’s book against him.
Bishop Tunstall confesses that he is relieved to hear
by the letter Erasmus had addressed to the king and
the legate that he had had nothing to do with this
violent composition, and, moreover, that he was opposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to Lutheran principles. In his letter on this
subject, the bishop laments the rapid spread of these
dangerous opinions which threaten disturbances everywhere.
When the sacred ceremonies of the Church
and all pious customs are attacked as they are, he says,
civil tumults are sure to follow. After Luther’s book
<i>De abroganda Missa</i>, the Reformer will quickly go
further, and so Tunstall begs and beseeches Erasmus,
by “Christ’s Passion and glory” and “by the reward”
he expects; “yea, and the Church itself prays and
desires you,” he adds, “to engage in combat with this
hydra.”<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>At length, urged by so many of his best friends,
Erasmus took up his pen against Luther and produced
his book <i>De libero Arbitrio</i>, to which Luther, a past
master in invective, replied in his contemptuous <i>De servo
Arbitrio</i>, Erasmus rejoining in the <i>Hyperaspistes</i>. Sir
Thomas More wrote that this last book delighted him, and
urged Erasmus to further attacks. “I cannot say how
foolish and inflated I think Luther’s letter to you,” he
writes. “He knows well how the wretched glosses into
which he has darkened Scripture turn to ice at your
touch. They were, it is true, cold enough already.”<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus’s volume on <i>Free-will</i> drew down on him,
as might be expected, the anger of the advanced
Lutherans. Ulrich von Hutten, formerly a brilliant
follower of Erasmus and Reuchlin in their attempts
to secure a revival of letters, was now the leader of
the most reckless and forward of the young German
Lutherans, who assisted the Reformer by their violence
and their readiness to promote any and all of his doctrinal
changes by stirring up civil dissensions. Von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Hutten endeavoured to throw discredit upon Erasmus
by a brilliant and sarcastic attack upon it. In 1523,
Erasmus published what he called the <i>Spongia</i>, or reply
to the assertions of von Hutten on his honour and
character. The tract is really an apology or explanation
of his own position as regards the Lutherans, and
an assertion of his complete loyalty to the Church.
The book was in Froben’s hands for press in June
1523, but before it could appear in September von
Hutten had died. Erasmus, however, determined to
publish the work on account of the gravity of the issues.
It is necessary, if we would understand Erasmus’s position
fully, to refer to this work at some considerable
length. After complaining most bitterly that many
people had tried to defame him to the Pope and to his
English friends, and to make him a Lutheran whether
he would or no; and after defending his attitude towards
Reuchlin as consistent throughout, he meets
directly von Hutten’s assertion that he had condemned
the whole Dominican body. “I have never,” he says,
“been ill disposed to that Order. I have never been
so foolish as to wish ill to any Order. If it were necessary
to hate all Dominicans because, in the Order,
there were some bad members, on the same ground
it would be needful to detest all Orders, since in every
one there are many black sheep.” On the same principle
Christianity itself would be worthy of hatred.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
The fact really is that the Dominicans have many
members who are friendly to Erasmus, and who are
favourable to learning in general, and Scripture study
and criticism in particular.</p>

<p>In the same way, von Hutten had mistaken Erasmu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>s’s
whole attitude towards the Roman Church. He had
charged him with being inconsistent, in now praising,
now blaming the authorities. Erasmus characterises
this as the height of impudence. “Who,” he asks, “has
ever approved of the vices of the Roman authorities?
But, on the other hand, who has ever condemned the
Roman Church?”</p>

<p>Continuing, he declares that he has never been the
occasion of discord or tumult in any way, and appeals
with confidence to his numerous letters and works
as sufficient evidence of his love of peace. “I love
liberty,” he writes; “I neither can aid, nor desire to aid,
any faction.” Already many confess that they were
wrong in taking a part; and he sees many, who had
thrown in their lot with Luther, now drawing back, and
regretting that they had ever given any countenance to
him.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> His (Erasmus’s) sole object has been to promote
good letters, and to restore Theology to its simple and
true basis, the Holy Scripture. This he will endeavour
to do as long as he has life. “Luther,” he says, “I hold
to be a man liable to err, and one who has erred.
Luther, with the rest of his followers will pass away;
Christ alone remains for ever.”</p>

<p>In more than one place of this <i>Spongia</i>, Erasmus
complains bitterly that what he had said in joke, and as
mere pleasantry at the table, had been taken seriously.
“What is said over a glass of wine,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> “ought
not to be remembered and written down as a serious
statement of belief. Often at a feast, for example, we
have transferred the worldly sovereignty to Pope Julius,
and made Maximilian, the emperor, into the supreme
Pontiff. Thus, too, we have married monasteries of
monks to convents of nuns; we have sent armies of
them against the Turks, and colonised new islands with
them. In a word, we turn the universe topsy-turvy.
But, such whims are never meant to be taken seriously,
as our own true convictions.”</p>

<p>Von Hutten had complained that Erasmus had
spoken harshly about Luther, and hinted that he was
really actuated by a spirit of envy, on seeing Luther’s
books more read than his own. Erasmus denies that
he has ever called Luther by any harsh names, and
particularly that he has ever called him “heretic.”
He admits, however, that he had frequently spoken of
the movement as a “tragedy,” and he points to the
public discords and tumults then distracting Germany
as the best justification of this verdict.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Von Hutten having said that children were being
taught by their nurses to lisp the name Luther, Erasmus
declares that he cannot imagine whose children these
can be; for, he says, “I daily see how many influential,
learned, grave, and good men have come to curse his
very name.”</p>

<p>The most interesting portion, however, of the
<i>Spongia</i> is that in which, at considerable length,
Erasmus explains his real attitude to Rome and the
Pope. “Not even about the Roman See,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
“will I admit that I have ever spoken inconsistently.
I have never approved of its tyranny, rapacity, and
other vices about which of old common complaints
were heard from good men. Neither do I sweepingly
condemn ‘Indulgences,’ though I have always disliked
any barefaced traffic in them. What I think about
ceremonies, many places in my works plainly show.…
What it may mean ‘to reduce the Pope to order’ I
do not rightly understand. First, I think it must be
allowed that Rome is a Church, for no number of evils
can make it cease to be a Church, otherwise we should
have no Churches whatever. Moreover, I hold it to be
an orthodox Church; and this Church, it must be
admitted, has a Bishop. Let him be allowed also to
be Metropolitan, seeing there are very many archbishops
in countries where there has been no apostle, and Rome,
without controversy, had certainly SS. Peter and Paul,
the two chief apostles. Then how is it absurd that
among Metropolitans the chief place be granted to the
Roman Pontiff?”<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>As to the rest, Erasmus had never, he declares,
defended the excessive powers which for many years
the popes have usurped, and, like all men, he wishes
for a thorough apostolic man for Pope. For his part,
if the Pope were not above all things else an apostle,
he would have him deposed as well as any other
bishop, who did not fulfil the office of his state. For
many years, no doubt, the chief evils of the world have
come from Rome, but now, as he believes, the world has
a Pope who will try at all costs to purify the See and
Curia of Rome. This, however, Erasmus fancies is not
quite what von Hutten desires. He would declare war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
against the Pope and his adherents, even were the Pope
a good Pope, and his followers good Christians. War
is what von Hutten wants, and he cares not whether it
brings destruction to cities and peoples and countries.</p>

<p>Erasmus admits that he knows many people who
are ready to go some way in the Lutheran direction;
but who would strongly object to the overthrow of
papal authority. Many would rather feel that they
have a father than a tyrant: who would like to see
the tables of the money-changers in the temple overthrown,
and the barefaced granting of indulgences and
trafficking in dispensations and papal bulls repressed:
who would not object to have ceremonies simplified,
and solid piety inculcated: who would like to insist
on the sacred Scriptures as the true and only basis
of authoritative teaching, and would not give to scholastic
conclusions and the mere opinions of schools the
force of an infallible oracle. With those who think
thus, says Erasmus, “if (as is the case) there is no
compact on my part, certainly my old friendly feeling
for them remains cemented by the bond of learning,
even if I do not agree with them in all these things.”</p>

<p>But, he continues, it is not among these well-wishers
of reform that von Hutten and Luther will
find their support. This is to be found among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
“unlettered people without any judgment; among
those who are impure in their own lives, and detractors
of men; amongst those who are headstrong and ungovernable.
These are they who are so favourable
to Luther’s cause that they neither know nor care
to examine what Luther teaches. They only have the
Gospel on their lips; they neglect prayer and the
Sacraments; they eat what they like; and they live
to curse the Roman Pontiff. These are the Lutherans.”
From such material spring forth tumults that cannot
be put down. “It is generally in their cups,” adds
Erasmus, “that the Evangelical league is recruited.”
They are too stupid to see whither they are drifting,
and “with such a type of mankind I have no wish
to have anything to do.” Some make the Gospel but
the pretext for theft and rapine; and “there are some
who, having squandered or lost all their own property,
pretend to be Lutherans in order to be able to help
themselves to the wealth of others.” Von Hutten
wants me, says Erasmus, to come to them. “To
whom? To those who are good and actuated by the
true Gospel teaching? I would willingly fly to them
if any one will point them out. If he knew of any
Lutherans, who in place of wine, prostitutes, and dice,
have at any time delighted in holy reading and conversation;
of any who never cheat or neglect to pay
their debts, but are ready to give to the needy; of any
who look on injuries done to them as favours, who
bless those who curse them&mdash;if he can show me such
people, he may count on me as an associate. Lutherans,
I see; but followers of the Gospel, I can discover few
or none.”</p>

<p>Von Hutten had, in his attack, with much bitterness
condemned Erasmus for not renouncing connection
with those who had written strongly against
Luther. Erasmus refused to entertain the notion.
“There is,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> “the reverend Father John,
Bishop of Rochester. He has written a big volume
against Luther. For a long period that man has been
my very special friend and most constant patron.
Does von Hutten seriously want me to break with
him, because he has sharpened his pen in writing
against Luther? Long before Luther was thought
of,” he says, “I enjoyed the friendship of many
learned men. Of these, some in later years took
Luther’s side, but on that account I have not renounced
outwardly my friendship for them. Some
of these have changed their views and now do not
think much of Luther, still I do not cease to regard
them as my friends.”</p>

<p>Towards the close of his reply, Erasmus returns
to the question of the Pope. Von Hutten had charged
him with inconsistency in his views, and Erasmus replies,
“He who most desires to see the apostolic
character manifested in the Pope is most in his
favour.” It may be that one can hate the individual
and approve of the office. Whoever is favourable to,
and defends, bad Popes does not honour the office.
He (Erasmus) has been found fault with for saying
that the authority of the Pope has been followed by
the Christian world for very many ages. What he
wrote is true, and as long as the work of Christ is
done may it be followed for ever. Luther wants
people to take his <i>ipse dixit</i> and authority, but he
(Erasmus) would prefer to take that of the Pope.
“Even if the supremacy of the Pope was not established
by Christ, still it would be expedient that there
should be one ruler possessing full authority over
others, but which authority no doubt should be free
from all idea of tyranny.… Because I have criticised
certain points in the See of Rome, I have not
for that reason ever departed from it. Who would
not uphold the dignity of one who, by manifesting the
virtues of the Gospel, represents Christ to us?” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
paradoxes of Luther are not worth dying for. “There
is no question of articles of faith, but of such matters
as ‘Whether the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff was
established by Christ:’ ‘whether cardinals are necessary
to the Christian Church:’ ‘whether confession is
<i>de jure divino</i>:’ ‘whether bishops can make their laws
binding under pain of mortal sin:’ ‘whether free will
is necessary for salvation:’ ‘whether faith alone assures
salvation,’ &amp;c. If Christ gave him grace,” Erasmus
hopes that “he would be a martyr for His truth, but
he has no desire whatever to be one for Luther.”</p>

<p>This last point was immediately taken up by the
Lutherans. Von Hutten, as it has already been said,
had died before the publication of the <i>Spongia</i>, and the
reply to Erasmus was undertaken by Otto Brunfels.
He rejected Erasmus’s suggestion that nearly all that
the Lutherans were fighting for were matters of opinion.
They were matters of faith, he says, and no uncertainty
could be admitted on this point. In order to make
the matter clear, he enumerates a great number of
tenets of Lutheranism which they hold to as matters of
revealed certainty. For instance: that Christ is the
only head of the Church; that the Church has no
corporate existence; that the mass is no sacrifice; that
justification comes by faith alone; that our works are
sins and cannot justify; that good men cannot sin;
that there are only two Sacraments; that the Pope’s
traditions are heretical and against Scripture; that
the religious state is from the devil; and several score
more of similar points more or less important.</p>

<p>That Erasmus’s views upon the necessity of the
Papacy expressed in the <i>Spongia</i> were not inconsistent
with his previous position there is ample evidence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
his letters, to which he himself appeals. Replying, for
example, to one who had written to him deploring the
religious differences in Bohemia, Erasmus declares that,
in his opinion, it is needful for unity that there should
be one head. If the prince is tyrannical, he should be
reduced to order by the teaching and authority of the
Roman Pontiff. If the bishop play the tyrant, there is still
the authority of the Roman Pontiff, who is the dispenser
of the authority and the Vicar of Christ. He may not
please all, but who that really rules can expect to do
that? “In my opinion,” he adds, “those who reject
the Pope are more in error than they who demand
the Eucharist under two kinds.” Personally, he would
have allowed this, although he thinks that, as most
Christians have now the other custom, those who
demand it as a necessity are unreasonable and to be
greatly blamed. Above all others, he reprobates the
position of those who refuse to obey, speak of the Pope
as Antichrist, and the Roman Church as a “harlot”
because there have been bad Popes. There have been
bad cardinals and bishops, bad priests and princes, and
on this ground we ought not to obey bishop or pastor
or king or ruler.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> In the same letter he rebukes those
who desire to sweep away vestments and ceremonies
on the plea that they may not have been used in
apostolic times.</p>

<p>Later on, in another letter, he complained that people
call him a favourer of Luther. This is quite untrue.
“I would prefer,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> “to have Luther corrected
rather than destroyed; then I should prefer that it
should be done without any great social tumults.
Christ I acknowledge; Luther I know not. I acknowledge
the Roman Church, which, in my opinion,
is Catholic. I praise those who are on the side of the
Roman Pontiff, who is supported by every good man.”<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Again, the following year, writing on the subject of
the invocation of Papal authority against Luther, he
says: “I do not question the origin of that authority,
which is most certainly just, as in ancient times from
among many priests equal in office one was chosen as
the bishop; so now from the bishops it is necessary to
make choice of one Pontiff, not merely to prevent discords,
but to temper the tyrannical exercise of authority
on the part of the other bishops and secular princes.”<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The publication of Erasmus’s book against Luther
and of his reply to von Hutten made little change,
however, in the adverse feeling manifested against him
by those who were most busily engaged in combating
the spread of Lutheran opinions. As he wrote to King
Henry VIII., the noisy tumults and discords made him
long for the end of life, when he might hope at least
to find peace.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Luckily for him, he still retained the
confidence of the Pope and some of the best churchmen
in Europe. Had he not done so, the very violence
of the attack against his good name might have driven
him out of the Church in spite of himself. Kind words,
he more than once said, would have done more for the
cause of peace in the Church than all the biting sarcasm
and unmeasured invective that was launched
against Luther, and those who, like Erasmus, either
were, or were supposed to be, associated with his cause.
Luther was not delicate about the choice of his language
when he had an enemy to pelt, but some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
preachers and pamphlet writers on the orthodox side
were his match in this respect. In this way Erasmus
puts the responsibility for “the tragedy” of Lutheranism
upon the theologians, and in part especially upon the
Dominicans and Carmelites. “Ass,” “pig,” “sow,”
“heretic,” “antichrist,” and “pest of the world,” are
terms named by Erasmus as samples of the epithets
launched from the pulpit, or more deliberately set up in
type, as arguments against Luther and himself.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>In writing to one of the cardinals after the publication
of his <i>Spongia</i>, there is a touch of sadness in his
complaints, that having been forced to do battle with
the “Lutherans as against a hydra of many heads,”
Catholics should still try and make the world believe
that he was really a Lutheran at heart. “I have never,”
he declares, “doubted about the sovereignty of the
Pope, but whether this supremacy was recognised in
the time of St. Jerome, I have my doubts, on account of
certain passages I have noted in my edition of St.
Jerome. In the same place, however, I have marked
what would appear to make for the contrary opinion;
and in numerous other places I call Peter ‘Prince of
the apostolic order,’ and the Roman Pontiff, Christ’s
Vicar and the Head of His Church, giving him the
highest power according to Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Probably a more correct view of Erasmus’s real
mind can hardly be obtained than in part of a letter
already quoted (Ep. 501) addressed to Bishop Marlianus
of Tuy in Galicia, on March 25, 1520. “I would
have the Church,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> “purified, lest the good in
it suffer by conjunction with the evil. In avoiding the
Scylla of Luther, however, I would have care taken to
avoid Charybdis. If this be sin, then I own my
guilt. I have sought to save the dignity of the
Roman Pontiff, the honour of Catholic theology, and
to look to the welfare of Christendom. I have, as
yet, read no whole work of Luther, however short,
and I have never even in jest defended his paradoxes.
Be assured that if any movement is set on foot
which is injurious to the Christian religion and dangerous
to the public peace or the supremacy of the Holy
See, it does not proceed from Erasmus.… In all I
have written, I have not deviated one hair’s-breadth
from the teaching of the Church. But every wise man
knows that practices and teachings have been introduced
into the Church partly by custom, partly by the
canonists, partly by means of scholastic definitions,
partly by the tricks and arts of secular sovereigns, which
have no sound sanction. Many great people have
begged me to support Luther, but I have ever replied
that I would be ready to take his part when he was on
the Catholic side. They have asked me to draw up a
formula of faith; I have said that I know of none save
the creed of the Catholic Church, and every one who
consults me I urge to submit to the authority of the
Pope.”<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>In many ways Erasmus regarded the rise of Lutheranism
as the greatest misfortune. Not only did it tend
to make good men suspicious of the general revival of
letters, with which without reason they associated it, but
the necessity of defending the Catholic position against
the assaults of the new sectaries naturally obscured the
need of reform within the Church itself, for which far-seeing
and good men had long been looking. To Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Tunstall he expressed his fears lest in pulling up the
tares, some, and perchance much, of the precious wheat
might perish. Whilst, undoubtedly, there was in Luther’s
work a great deal that he cordially detested, there
was also much that would never have been condemned,
had the points been calmly considered by learned men,
apart from the ferment of revolt. “This, however, I
promise you,” he adds, “that for my part I will never
forsake the Church.”<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>This same sentiment he repeats the following year,
1526: “From the judgment of the Church I am not
able to dissent, nor have I ever dissented.”<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Had this
tempest not risen up, he said, in another letter from
Basle, he had hoped to have lived long enough to have
seen a general revival of letters and theology returning
more and more to the foundation of all true divinity,
Holy Scripture. For his part, he cordially disliked
controversy, and especially the discussion of such
questions as “whether the Council was above the Pope,”
and such like. He held that he was himself in all
things a sound Catholic, and at peace with the Pope
and his bishop, whilst no name was more hated by the
Lutherans than that of Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>So much with regard to the attitude of mind manifested
by Erasmus towards the authority of the teaching
Church, which is the main point of interest in the
present inquiry. His disposition will probably be construed
by some into a critical opposition to much that
was taught and practised; but it seems certain that
Erasmus did not so regard his own position. He was
a reformer in the best sense, as so many far-seeing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
spiritual-minded churchmen of those days were. He
desired to better and beautify and perfect the system he
found in vogue, and he had the courage of his convictions
to point out what he thought stood in need of
change and improvement, but he was no iconoclast;
he had no desire to pull down or root up or destroy
under the plea of improvement. That he remained to
the last the friend of Popes and bishops and other
orthodox churchmen, is the best evidence, over and
above his own words, that his real sentiments were not
misunderstood by men who had the interests of the
Church at heart, and who looked upon him as true and
loyal, if perhaps a somewhat eccentric and caustic son
of Holy Church. Even in his last sickness he received
from the Pope proof of his esteem, for he was given a
benefice of considerable value, and it was hinted to him
that another honour, as was commonly supposed at the
time nothing less than the sacred purple, was in store
for him.</p>

<p>Most people are of course chiefly interested in the
determination of Erasmus’s general attitude to the great
religious movement of the age. In this place, however,
one or two minor points in his literary history can hardly
be passed over in silence. His attitude to the monks and
the religious Orders generally, was one of acknowledged
hostility, although there are passages in his writings,
some of which have been already quoted, which seem
to show that this hostility was neither so sweeping nor
so deeply rooted as is generally thought. Still, it may
be admitted that he has few good words for the religious
Orders, and he certainly brings many and even grave
accusations against their good name. There is little
doubt, however, that much he had to say on the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
was, as he himself tells us, said to emphasise abuses that
existed, and was not intended to be taken as any wholesale
sweeping condemnation of the system of regular
life. Very frequently the <i>Enconium Moriæ</i> has been
named as the work in which Erasmus hits the monks
the hardest. Those who so regard it can hardly have
read it with attention, and most certainly they fail to
appreciate its spirit. It was composed, as we have seen,
at Sir Thomas More’s suggestion, and in his house at
Chelsea in 1512, on Erasmus’s return from Italy. It
is a satire on the ecclesiastical manners and customs in
which all abuses in turn come in for their share of sarcastic
condemnation; superstitions of people as to
particular days and images, superstitions about “magic
prayers and charmlike rosaries,” as to saints set to this
or that office, to cure the toothache, to discover stolen
goods, &amp;c., in the first place came under the lash of
Erasmus’s sarcasm. Then come, in turn, doctors of
divinity and theologians, “a nest of men so crabbed
and morose” that he has half a mind, he says, to leave
them severely alone, “lest perchance they should all at
once fall upon me with six hundred conclusions, driving
me to recant.” They are high and mighty and look
down on other men, thinking of common individuals as
“silly men like worms creeping on the ground,” and
startling ordinary folk by the variety of their unpractical
discussions and questions. “Nowadays,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
“not baptism, nor the Gospel, nor Paul, nor Peter,
nor Jerome, nor Augustine, nor yet Thomas Aquinas,
are able to make men Christians, unless those Father
Bachelors in divinity are pleased to subscribe to the
same. They require us to address them as <i>Magister
noster</i> in the biggest of letters.”</p>

<p>Following upon this treatment of the scholastic
theologians come the few pages devoted to monks, those
“whose trade and observance were surely most miserable
and abject, unless I (Folly) did many ways assist
them.” They are so ignorant (at least so says Folly),
that they can hardly read their own names. Erasmus
makes merry over the office they chant, and the begging
practised by the friars, and jeers amusingly at their
style of dressing, at their mode of cutting their hair, and
at their sleeping and working by <i>rule</i>. “Yea,” he says,
“some of them being of a straightened rule are such
sore punishers of their flesh, as outwardly they wear
nought but sackcloth and inwardly no better than fine
holland.” In a word, he laughs at the general observance
of regular life, and in one place only passes a hint
that some of their lives are not so saintly as they pretend.
As a whole, however, the sarcasm is not so
bitter as that addressed to other ecclesiastics, and even
to the Pope himself. In view of Sir Thomas More’s
subsequent explanation about the spirit of the <i>Enconium
Moriæ</i>, there can be no doubt that it was intended
mainly as a playful, if somewhat ill-judged and severe,
lampoon on some patent abuses, and in no sense an
attack upon the ecclesiastical system of the Catholic
Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>One other misunderstanding about Erasmus’s position
in regard to the revival of letters may be here
noticed. The great scholar has been regarded as the
incarnation of the spirit of practical paganism, which,
unfortunately, was quickly the outcome of the movement
in Italy, and which at this time gave so much
colour and point to the denunciations of those of the
opposite school. No view can be more unjust to Erasmus.
Though he longed anxiously for the clergy to
awake to a sense of the importance of studies in general,
of classical and scriptural studies in particular, there
was no one who saw more clearly the danger and
absurdity of carrying the classical revivalist spirit to
extremes. In fact, in his <i>Ciceroniana</i>, he expressly ridicules
what he has seen in Rome of the classical spirit
run mad. Those afflicted by it, he says, try to think
that old Rome has returned. They speak of the
“Senate,” the “conscript fathers,” the “plebs,” the
“chief auger,” and the “college of soothsayers,” “Pontifices
Maximi,” “Vestals,” “triumphs,” &amp;c. Nothing
can be more unlike the true Ciceronian spirit. Am I,
he asks, as a Christian speaking to Christians about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Christian religion to try and suppose I am living in the
age of Cicero, and speak as if I were addressing a meeting
of the conscript fathers on the Capitol? Am I to
pick my words, choose my figures and illustrations from
Cicero’s speeches to the Senate? How can Cicero’s
eloquence help me to speak to a mixed audience of
virgins, wives, and widows in praise of fasting, penance,
prayer, almsgiving, the sanctity of marriage, the contempt
of the fleeting pleasures of this world, or of the
study of Holy Scripture. No, a Christian orator dressed
in Cicero’s clothes is ridiculous.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>As an illustration of the height of absurdity to
which the madness of the classical craze had brought
people in Rome in his day, Erasmus relates the story
of a sermon he himself once heard in the Eternal City
during the pontificate of Pope Julius II. “I had been
invited,” he says, “a few days before, by some learned
men to be present at this sermon (to be preached on
Good Friday). ‘Take care not to miss it,’ they said,
‘for you will at last be enabled to appreciate the tone
of the Roman language, spoken by a Roman mouth.’
Hence, with great curiosity, I went to the church,
procuring a place near the orator so as not to miss
even one word. Julius II. was himself present, a very
unusual thing, probably on account of his health. And
there were also there many cardinals and bishops, and
in the crowd most of the men of letters who were then
in Rome.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>“The exordium and peroration were nearly as
long as the rest of the discourse, and they all rang
the changes of praise of Julius II. He called him the
almighty Jove, and pictured him as brandishing the
trident, casting his thunderbolts with his right hand,
and accomplishing all he willed by the mere nod of his
head. All that had taken place of late years in Gaul,
Germany, Spain, &amp;c., were but the efforts of his simple
will. Then came a hundred times repeated, such
words as ‘Rome,’ ‘Romans,’ ‘Roman mouth,’ ‘Roman
eloquence,’ &amp;c.” But what, asks Erasmus, were all
these to Julius, bishop of the Christian religion, Christ’s
vicegerent, successor of Peter and Paul? What are
these to cardinals and bishops who are in the places
of the other apostles?</p>

<p>“The orator’s design,” he continues, “was to represent
to us Jesus Christ, at first in the agony of His
Passion, and then in the glory of His triumph. To do
this, he recalled the memory of Curtius and Decius,
who had given themselves to the gods for the salvation
of the Republic. He reminded us of Cecrops, of
Menelaus, of Iphigenia, and of other noble victims
who had valued their lives less than the honour and
welfare of their country. Public gratitude (he continued,
in tears and in most lugubrious tones) had
always surrounded these noble and generous characters
with its homage, sometimes raising gilded statues to
their memory in the forum; sometimes decreeing
them even divine honours, whilst Jesus Christ, for all
His benefits, had received no other reward but death.
The orator then went on to compare our Saviour, who
had deserved so well of His country, to Phocion and to
Socrates, who were compelled to drink hemlock though
accused of no crime; to Epaminondas, driven to defend
himself against envy roused by his noble deeds; to
Scipio and to Aristides, whom the Athenians were tired
of hearing called the ‘Just one,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“I ask, can anything be imagined colder and more
inept? Yet, over all his efforts, the preacher sweated
blood and water to rival Cicero. In brief, my Roman
preacher spoke Roman so well that I heard nothing
about the death of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> If Cicero had lived in our
days,” asks Erasmus, “would he not think the name of
God the Father as elegant as Jupiter the almighty?
Would he think it less elegant to speak of Jesus Christ
than of Romulus, or of Scipio Africanus, of Quintus
Curtius, or of Marcus Decius? Would he think the
name of the Catholic Church less illustrious than that
of ‘Conscript Fathers,’ ‘Quirites,’ or ‘Senate and people
of Rome’? He would speak to us of faith in Christ,
of the Holy Ghost, or the Holy Trinity?” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>At considerable length Erasmus pours out the vials
of his scorn upon those who act so foolishly under the
influence of the false classical spirit. He points out
the danger to be avoided. People, he says, go into
raptures over pagan antiquities, and laugh at others
who are enthusiastic about Christian archæology. “We
kiss, venerate, almost adore a piece of antiquity,” he
says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> “and mock at relics of the Apostles. If any one
finds something from the twelve tables, who does not
consider it worthy of the most holy place? And the
laws written by the finger of God, who venerates, who
kisses them? How delighted we are with a medal
stamped with the head of Hercules, or of Mercury, or
of Fortune, or of Victory, or of Alexander the Great, or
one of the Cæsars,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and we deride those who treasure
the wood of the cross or images of the Virgin and
saints as superstitious.”<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> If in dealing with his subject
Erasmus may appear to exaggerate the evil he condemns,
this much is clear, that his advocacy of letters
and learning, however strenuous and enthusiastic, was
tempered by a sense of the paramount importance of
the Christian spirit in the pursuit of science.</p>

<p>It is not uncommonly asserted that the religious
changes in England, although for convenience’ sake
dated from the rejection of Papal supremacy, were
in reality the outcome of long-continued and ever-increasing
dissatisfaction with the then existing ecclesiastical
system. The Pope’s refusal to grant Henry his
wished-for divorce from Katherine, we are told, was
a mere incident, which at most, precipitated by a
short while what had long been inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
who take this view are bound to believe that the
Church in England in the early sixteenth century was
honeycombed by disbelief in the traditional teachings,
and that men were only too ready to welcome emancipation.
What then is the evidence for this picture of
the religious state of men’s minds in England on the
eve of the Reformation?</p>

<p>It is, indeed, not improbable that up and down
the country there were, at this period, some dissatisfied
spirits; some who would eagerly seize any opportunity
to free themselves from the restraints which no longer
appealed to their consciences, and from teachings they
had come to consider as mere ecclesiastical formalism.
A Venetian traveller of intelligence and observation,
who visited the country at the beginning of the century,
whilst struck with the Catholic practices and with the
general manifestations of English piety he witnessed,
understood that there were “many who have various
opinions concerning religion.”<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> But so far as there
is evidence at all, it points to the fact, that of religious
unrest, in any real sense, there could have been very
little in the country generally. It is, of course, impossible
to suppose that any measurable proportion of
the people could have openly rejected the teaching of
the Church or have been even crypto-Lollards, without
there being satisfactory evidence of the fact forthcoming
at the present day.</p>

<p>The similarity of the doctrines held by the English
Reformers of the sixteenth century with many of those
taught by the followers of Wycliffe has, indeed, led some
writers to assume a direct connection between them
which certainly did not exist in fact. So far as England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
at least is concerned, there is no justification for
assuming for the Reformation a line of descent from any
form of English Lollardism. It is impossible to study
the century which preceded the overthrow of the old
religious system in England without coming to the
conclusion that as a body the Lollards had been long
extinct, and that as individuals, scattered over the
length and breadth of the land, without any practical
principle of cohesion, the few who clung to the tenets
of Wycliffe were powerless to effect any change of
opinion in the overwhelming mass of the population
at large. Lollardry, to the Englishman of the day, was
“heresy,” and any attempt to teach it was firmly
repressed by the ecclesiastical authority, supported by
the strong arm of the State; but it was also an offence
against the common feeling of the people, and there can
be no manner of doubt that its repression was popular.
The genius of Milton enabled him to see the fact that
“Wycliffe’s preaching was soon damped and stifled by
the Pope and prelates for six or seven kings’ reigns,”
and Mr. James Gairdner, whose studies in this period
of our national history enable him to speak with
authority, comes to the same conclusion. “Notwithstanding
the darkness that surrounds all subjects connected
with the history of the fifteenth century,” he
writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> “we may venture pretty safely to affirm that
Lollardry was <i>not</i> the beginning of modern Protestantism.
Plausible as it seems to regard Wycliffe as ‘the
morning star of the Reformation,’ the figure conveys
an impression which is altogether erroneous. Wycliffe’s
real influence did not long survive his own day, and
so far from Lollardry having taken any deep root among
the English people, the traces of it had wholly disappeared
long before the great revolution of which it
is thought to be the forerunner. At all events, in the
rich historical material for the beginning of Henry
VIII.’s reign, supplied by the correspondence of the
time, we look in vain for a single indication that any
such thing as a Lollard sect existed. The movement
had died a natural death; from the time of Oldcastle
it sank into insignificance. Though still for a while
considerable in point of numbers, it no longer counted
among its adherents any men of note; and when
another generation had passed away the serious action
of civil war left no place for the crotchets of
fanaticism.”<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>On the only evidence available, the student of the
reign of Henry VII. and of that of Henry VIII. up to
the breach with Rome is bound to come to the same
conclusion as to the state of the English Church. If
we except manifestations of impatience with the Pope
and Curia, which could be paralleled in any age and
country, and which were rather on the secular side than
on the religious, there is nothing that would make us think
that England was not fully loyal in mind and heart to the
established ecclesiastical system. In fact, as Mr. Brewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
says, everything proves that “the general body of the
people had not as yet learned to question the established
doctrines of the Church. For the most part, they paid
their Peter pence and heard mass, and did as their
fathers had done before them.”<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>It may be taken, therefore, for granted that the
seeds of religious discord were not the product of the
country itself, nor, so far as we have evidence on the
subject at all, does it appear that the soil of the country
was in any way specially adapted for its fructification.
The work, both of raising the seed and of scattering it
over the soil of England, must be attributed, if the plain
facts of history are to be believed, to Germans and the
handful of English followers of the German Reformers.
If we would rightly understand the religious situation
in England at the commencement of the Reformation,
it is of importance to inquire into the methods of attack
adopted in the Lutheran invasion, and to note the chief
doctrinal points which were first assailed.</p>

<p>Very shortly after the religious revolt had established
itself in Germany, the first indications of a serious attempt
to undermine the traditional faith of the English Church
became manifest in England. Roger Edgworth, a preacher
during the reigns of Henry and Queen Mary, says that
his “long labours have been cast in most troublesome
times and most encumbered with errors and heresies,
change of minds and schisms that ever was in the
realm.… Whilst I was a young student in divinity,”
he continues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> “Luther’s heresies rose and were scattered
here in this realm, which, in less space than a man
would think, had so sore infected the Christian folk,
first the youth and then the elders, where the children
could set their fathers to school, that the king’s
Majesty and all Christian clerks in the realm had much
ado to extinguish them. This they could not so perfectly
quench, but that ever since, when they might
have any maintenance by man or woman of great
power, they burst forth afresh, even like fire hid under
chaff.”<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas More, when Chancellor in 1532,
attributed the rapid spread of what to him and most
people of his day in England was heresy, to the
flood of literature which was poured forth over the
country by the help of printing. “We have had,” he
writes, “some years of late, plenteous of evil books.
For they have grown up so fast and sprung up
so thick, full of pestilent errors and pernicious
heresies, that they have infected and killed, I fear
me, more simple souls than the famine of the dear
years have destroyed bodies.”<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>We are not left in ignorance as to the books here
referred to, as some few years previously the bishops
of England had issued a list of the prohibited volumes.
Thus, in October 1526, Bishop Tunstall ordered that
in London people should be warned not to read the
works in question, but that all who possessed them
should deliver them over to the bishop’s officials in
order that they might be destroyed as pernicious literature.
The list included several works of Luther, three
or four of Tyndale, a couple of Zwingle, and several
isolated works, such as the <i>Supplication of Beggars</i>, and
the <i>Dyalogue between the Father and the Son</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>In 1530 the king by proclamation forbade the reading
or possession of some eighty-five works of Wycliffe,
Luther, Œcolampadius, Zwingle, Pomeranus, Bucer,
Wesselius, and indeed the German divines generally,
under the heading of “books of the Lutheran sect or
faction conveyed into the city of London.” Besides
these Latin treatises, the prohibition included many
English tracts, such as <i>A book of the old God and the new</i>,
the <i>Burying of the Mass</i>, Frith’s <i>Disputation concerning
Purgatory</i>, and several prayer-books intended to propagate
the new doctrines, such as <i>Godly prayers</i>; <i>Matins
and Evensong with the seven Psalms and other heavenly
psalms with commendations</i>; the <i>Hortulus Animæ</i> in
English,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and the <i>Primer</i> in English.</p>

<p>In his proclamation Henry VIII. speaks of the
determination of the English nation in times past to
be true to the Catholic faith and to defend the country
against “wicked sects of heretics and Lollards, who,
by perversion of Holy Scripture, do induce erroneous
opinions, sow sedition amongst Christian people, and
disturb the peace and tranquillity of Christian realms,
as lately happened in some parts of Germany, where,
by the procurement and sedition of Martin Luther and
other heretics, were slain an infinite number of Christian
people.” To prevent like misfortunes happening in
England, he orders prompt measures to be taken to
put a stop to the circulation of books in English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
other languages, which teach things “intolerable to the
clean ears of any good Christian man.”<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>By the king’s command, the convocation of Canterbury
drew up a list of prohibited heretical books. In
the first catalogue of fifty-three tracts and volumes,
there is no mention of any work of Wycliffe, and besides
some volumes which had come from the pens of Tyndale,
Frith, and Roy, who were acknowledged disciples
of Luther, the rest are all the compositions of the German
Reformers. The same may be said of a supplementary
list of tracts, the authors of which were
unknown. All these are condemned as containing
false teaching, plainly contrary to the Catholic faith,
and the bishops add: “Moreover, following closely
in the footsteps of our fathers, we prohibit all from
selling, giving, reading, distributing, or publishing any
tract, booklet, pamphlet, or book, which translates or
interprets the Holy Scripture in the vernacular …
or even knowingly to keep such volumes without the
licence of their diocesan in writing.”<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>About the same time a committee of bishops, including
Archbishop Warham and Bishop Tunstall was
appointed to draw up a list of some of the principal
errors contained in the prohibited works of English
heretics beyond the sea. The king had heard that
“many books in the English tongue containing many
detestable errors and damnable opinions, printed in
parts beyond the sea,” were being brought into England
and spread abroad. He was unwilling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> “such
evil seed sown amongst his people (should) so take root
that it might overgrow the corn of the Catholic doctrine
before sprung up in the souls of his subjects,” and he
consequently ordered this examination. This has been
done and the errors noted, “albeit many more there be
in those books; which books totally do swarm full of
heresies and detestable opinions.” The books thus
examined and noted were eight in number: <i>The Wicked
Mammon</i>; the <i>Obedience of Christian man</i>; the <i>Revelation
of Antichrist</i>; the <i>Sum of Scripture</i>; the <i>Book of Beggars</i>;
the <i>Kalendar of the Prymer</i>; the <i>Prymer</i>, and an <i>Exposition
unto the Seventh Chapter of I Corinthians</i>. From
these some hundreds of propositions were culled which
contradicted the plain teaching of the Church in matters
of faith and morality. In this condemnation, as the
king states in his directions to preachers to publish the
same, the commission were unanimous.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The attack on the traditional teachings of the
Church, moreover, was not confined to unimportant
points. From the first, high and fundamental doctrines,
as it seemed to men in those days, were put in peril.
The works sent forth by the advocates of the change
speak for themselves, and, when contrasted with those
of Luther, leave no room for doubt that they were
founded on them, and inspired by the spirit of the
leader of the revolt, although, as was inevitable in
such circumstances, in particulars the disciples proved
themselves in advance of their master. Writing in
1546, Dr. Richard Smythe contrasts the old times,
when the faith was respected, with the then state of
mental unrest in religious matters. “In our days,”
he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> “not a few things, nor of small importance,
but (alack the more is the pity) even the chiefest and
most weighty matters of our religion and faith are
called in question, babbled, talked, and jangled upon
(reasoned I cannot nor ought not to call it). These
matters in time past (when reason had place and virtue
with learning was duly regarded, yea, and vice with
insolency was generally detested and abhorred) were
held in such reverence and honour, in such esteem and
dignity, yea, so received and embraced by all estates,
that it was not in any wise sufferable that tag and rag,
learned and unlearned, old and young, wise and foolish,
boys and wenches, master and man, tinkers and tilers,
colliers and coblers, with other such raskabilia might at
their pleasure rail and jest (for what is it else they now
do?) against everything that is good and virtuous,
against all things that are expedient and profitable,
not sparing any Sacrament of the Church or ordinance
of the same, no matter how laudable, decent,
or fitting it has been regarded in times past, or how
much it be now accepted by good and Catholic men.
In this way, both by preaching and teaching (if it so
ought to be called), playing, writing, printing, singing,
and (Oh, good Lord!) in how many other ways besides,
divers of our age, being their own schoolmasters, or
rather scholars of the devil, have not forborne or feared
to speak and write against the most excellent and most
blessed Sacrament of the Altar, affirming that the said
Sacrament is nothing more than a bare figure, and that
there is not in the same Sacrament the very body and
blood of our blessed Saviour and Redeemer, Jesus
Christ, but only a naked sign, a token, a memorial and
a remembrance only of the same, if they take it for so
much even and do not call it (as they are wont to do)
an idol and very plain idolatry.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>As to the date of the introduction of these heretical
views into England, Sir Thomas More entirely agreed
with Dr. Smythe, the writer just quoted. He places
the growth of these ideas in the circulation of books by
Tyndale, Frith, and Barnes, and even as late as 1533,
declares that the number of those who had accepted
the new teaching was grossly exaggerated. He states
his belief that “the realm is not full of heretics, and it
has in it but a few, though that few be indeed over
many and grown more also by negligence in some part
than there has been in some late years past.”<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> It was,
indeed, part of the strategy pursued by the innovators
in religion to endeavour to make the movement appear
more important than it had any claim to be. It is,
writes More, the “policy” of “these heretics who call
themselves ‘evangelical brethren,’” to make their
number appear larger than it is. “Some pot-headed
apostles they have that wander about the realm into
sundry shires, for whom every one has a different name
in every shire, and some, peradventure, in corners here
and there they bring into the brotherhood. But whether
they get any or none they do not hesitate to lie when
they come home, and say that more than half of every
shire is of their own sect. Boast and brag these blessed
brethren never so fast, they feel full well themselves
that they be too feeble in what country so ever they
be strongest. For if they thought themselves able to
meet and match the Catholics they would not, I ween,
lie still at rest for three days.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p>“For in all places where heresies have sprung up
hitherto so hath it proved yet. And so negligently
might these things be handled, that at length it might
happen so here. And verily they look (far as they be
yet from the power) for it, and some of them have not
hesitated to say this, and some to write it, too. For I
read the letter myself which was cast into the palace of
the Right Reverend Father in God, Cuthbert, now
Bishop of Durham, but then Bishop of London, in
which among other bragging word … were these
words contained: ‘There will once come a day.’ And
out of question that day they long for but also daily
look for, and would, if they were not too weak, not fail
to find it. And they have the greater hope because
… they see that it begins to grow into a custom that
among good Catholic folk they are suffered to talk
unchecked.” For good men in their own minds indeed
think the Catholic faith so strong that heretics with all
their babbling will never be able to vanquish it, “and in
this undoubtedly their mind is not only good, but also
very true. But they do not look far enough. For as
the sea will never surround and overwhelm all the land,
and yet has eaten it in many places, and swallowed
whole countries up and made many places sea, which
sometime were well-inhabited lands, and has lost part
of its own possession again in other places, so, though
the faith of Christ shall never be overwhelmed with
heresy, nor the gate of hell prevail against Christ’s
Church, yet as in some places it winneth in new peoples,
so by negligence in some places the old may be lost.”<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas More is all for vigilance on the part of
the authorities. He likens those who are in power and
office to the guardians of a fertile field who are bound
to prevent the sowing of tares on their master’s land;
and the multiplication of evil books and their circulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
among the people, cannot, in his opinion, have any
other effect than to prevent the fertilisation of the good
seed of God’s word in the hearts of many. “These new
teachers,” he says, “despise Christ’s Sacraments, which
are His holy ordinances and a great part of Christ’s New
Law and Testament. Who can place less value on His
commandments than they who, upon the boldness of
faith only, set all good works at naught, and little consider
the danger of their evil deeds upon the boldness
that a bare faith and slight repentance, without shrift or
penance, suffices, and that no vow made to God can
bind a man to live chastely or hinder a monk from
marriage. All these things, with many pestilent errors
besides, these abominable books of Tyndale and his
fellows teach us. Of these books of heresies there are
so many made within these few years, what by Luther
himself and by his fellows, and afterwards by the new
sects sprung out of his, which, like the children of
Vippara, would now gnaw out their mother’s belly, that
the bare names of those books were almost enough to
make a book. Some of every sort of those books are
brought into this realm and kept in ‘hucker mucker’
by some shrewd masters who keep them for no good.
Besides the Latin, French, and German books of which
these evil sects have put forth an innumerable number,
there are some made in the English tongue. First,
Tyndale’s <i>English Testament</i>, father of them all by reason
of his false translating, and after that, the <i>Five Books of
Moses</i> translated by the same man; we need not doubt
in what manner and for what purpose. Then you have
his <i>Introduction to Saint Paul’s Epistle</i>, with which he introduces
his readers to a false understanding of Saint
Paul, making them believe, among many other heresies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
that Saint Paul held that faith only was always sufficient
for salvation, and that men’s good works were worth
nothing and could not deserve thanks or reward in
heaven, although they were done in grace.… Then
we have from Tyndale <i>The Wicked Mammona</i>, by which
many a man has been beguiled and brought into many
wicked heresies, which in good faith would be to me a
matter of no little wonder, for there was never a more
foolish frantic book, were it not that the devil is ever
ready to put out the eyes of those who are content to
become blind. Then we have Tyndale’s <i>Book of Obedience</i>,
by which we are taught to disobey the teaching of
Christ’s Catholic Church and set His holy Sacraments
at naught. Then we have from Tyndale the <i>First
Epistle of Saint John</i>, expounded in such wise that I dare
say that blessed Apostle had rather his Epistle had
never been put in writing than that his holy words
should be believed by all Christian people in such a
sense. Then we have the <i>Supplication of Beggars</i>, a
piteous beggarly book, in which he would have all the
souls in Purgatory beg all about for nothing. Then we
have from George Joye, otherwise called Clarke, a
<i>Goodly Godly Epistle</i>, wherein he teaches divers other
heresies, but specially that men’s vows and promises of
chastity are not lawful, and can bind no man in conscience
not to wed when he will. And this man, considering
that when a man teaches one thing and does
another himself, the people set less value by his preaching,
determined therefore with himself, that he would
show himself an example of his preaching. Therefore,
being a priest, he has beguiled a woman and wedded
her; the poor woman, I ween, being unaware that he is
a priest. Then you have also an <i>Exposition on the Seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Chapter of Saint Paul’s Epistle to the Corinthians</i>, by which
exposition also priests, friars, monks, and nuns are
taught the evangelical liberty that they may run out
a-caterwauling and wed. That work has no name of
the maker, but some think it was Friar Roy who, when
he had fallen into heresy, then found it unlawful to live
in chastity and ran out of his Order. Then have we
the <i>Examinations of Thorpe</i> put forth as it is said by
George Constantine (by whom I know well there has
been a great many books of that sort sent into this
realm). In that book, the heretic that made it as (if it
were) a communication between the bishop and his
chaplains and himself, makes all the parties speak as he
himself likes, and sets down nothing as spoken against
his heresies, but what he himself would seem solemnly
to answer. When any good Christian man who has
either learning or any natural wit reads this book, he
shall be able not only to perceive him for a foolish
heretic and his arguments easy to answer, but shall also
see that he shows himself a false liar in his rehearsal of
the matter in which he makes the other part sometimes
speak for his own convenience such manner of things
as no man who was not a very wild goose would have
done.</p>

<p>“Then have we <i>Jonas</i> made out by Tyndale, a book
that whosoever delight therein shall stand in such peril,
that Jonas was never so swallowed up by the whale, as
by the delight of that book a man’s soul may be so
swallowed by the devil that he shall never have the
grace to get out again. Then, we have from Tyndale
the answer to my <i>Dyalogue</i>. Then, the book of Frith
against <i>Purgatory</i>. Then, the book of Luther translated
into English in the name of Brightwell, but, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
I am informed, it was translated by Frith; a book,
such as Tyndale never made one more foolish nor one
more full of lies.… Then, we have the <i>Practice of
Prelates</i>, wherein Tyndale intended to have made a
special show of his high worldly wit, so that men
should have seen therein that there was nothing done
among princes that he was not fully advertised of the
secrets. Then, we have now the book of Friar
Barnes, sometime a doctor of Cambridge, who was
abjured before this time for heresy, and is at this day
come under a safe conduct to the realm. Surely, of
all their books that yet came abroad in English (of all
which there was never one wise nor good) there was
none so bad, so foolish, so false as his. This, since
his coming, has been plainly proved to his face, and
that in such wise that, when the books that he cites
and alleges in his book were brought forth before him,
and his ignorance showed him, he himself did in divers
things confess his oversight, and clearly acknowledged
that he had been mistaken and wrongly understood
the passages.</p>

<p>“Then, we have besides Barnes’s book, the <i>A B C
for children</i>. And because there is no grace therein,
lest we should lack prayers, we have the <i>Primer</i> and
the <i>Ploughman’s Prayer</i> and a book of other small
devotions, and then the whole <i>Psalter</i> too. After the
<i>Psalter</i>, children were wont to go straight to their
<i>Donat</i> and their Accidence, but now they go straight to
Scripture. And for this end we have as a Donat, the
book of the <i>Pathway to Scripture</i>, and for an Accidence,
the <i>Whole sum of Scripture</i> in a little book, so that after
these books are learned well, we are ready for Tyndale’s
<i>Pentateuchs</i> and Tyndale’s <i>Testament</i>, and all the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
high heresies that he and Joye and Frith and Friar
Barnes teach in all their books. Of all these heresies
the seed is sown, and prettily sprung up in these little
books before. For the <i>Primer</i> and <i>Psalter</i>, prayers and
all, were translated and made in this manner by heretics
only. The <i>Psalter</i> was translated by George Joye, the
priest that is wedded now, and I hear say the <i>Primer</i>
too, in which the seven Psalms are printed without the
Litany, lest folks should pray to the saints; and the
<i>Dirge</i> is left out altogether, lest a man might happen
to pray with it for his father’s soul. In their Calendar,
before their devout prayers, they have given us a new
saint, Sir Thomas Hytton, the heretic who was burned
in Kent. They have put him in on St. Matthew’s Eve,
by the name of St. Thomas the Martyr.</p>

<p>“It would be a long work to rehearse all their
books, for there are yet more than I have known.
Against all these the king’s high wisdom politically
provided, in that his proclamation forbade any manner
of English books printed beyond the sea to be brought
into this realm, or any printed within this realm to be
sold unless the name of the printer and his dwelling-place
were set upon the book. But still, as I said
before, a few malicious, mischievous persons have
now brought into this realm these ungracious books
full of pestilent, poisoned heresies that have already in
other realms killed, by schisms and war, many thousand
bodies, and by sinful errors and abominable heresies
many more thousand souls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p>“Although these books cannot either be there
printed without great cost, nor here sold without
great adventure and peril, yet, with money sent hence,
they cease not to print them there, and send them
hither by the whole sacks full at once; and in some
places, looking for no lucre, cast them abroad at night,
so great a pestilent pleasure have some devilish people
caught with the labour, travail, cast, charge, peril,
harm, and hurt of themselves to seek the destruction
of others.”<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>In his introduction to the <i>Confutation</i> of Tyndale’s
answer, from which the foregoing extracts are taken,
Sir Thomas More gives ample evidence that the teaching
of “the New Learning” was founded entirely upon that
of the German Reformer Luther, although on certain
points his English followers had gone beyond their
master. He takes for example what Hytton, “whom
Tyndale has canonized,” had been teaching “his holy
congregations, in divers corners and luskes lanes.”
Baptism, he had allowed to be “a sacrament necessary
for salvation,” though he declared that there was no
need for a priest to administer it. Matrimony, he
thought a good thing for Christians, but would be
sorry to say it was a sacrament. Extreme Unction
and Confirmation, together with Holy Orders, he
altogether rejected as sacraments, declaring them to
be mere ceremonies of man’s invention. “The mass,”
he declared, “should never be said,” since to do so was
rather an act of sin than virtue. Confession to a priest
was unnecessary, and the penance enjoined was “without
profit to the soul.” Purgatory he denied, “and said
further, that neither prayer nor fasting for the souls
departed can do them any good.” Religious vows
were wrong, and those who entered religion “sinned
in so doing.” He held further, that “no man had any
free-will after he had once sinned;” that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> “all the
images of Christ and His saints should be thrown out
of the Church,” and that whatsoever laws “the Pope
or a General Council might make beyond what is
expressly commanded in Scripture” need not be
obeyed. “As touching the Sacrament of the Altar,
he said that it was a necessary sacrament, but held
that after the consecration, there was nothing whatever
therein, but only the very substance of material bread
and wine.”<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Now, it was to defend these points of Catholic
faith, as More, in common with the most learned in
the land, believed them to be, that he took up his pen
against Tyndale and others. I wish, he says, to second
“the king’s gracious purpose, as being his most unworthy
chancellor,” since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> “I know well that the king’s
highness, for his faithful mind to God, desires nothing
more effectually than the maintenance of the true
Catholic faith, whereof is his no more honourable
than well-deserved title, ‘defensor.’ He detests nothing
more than these pestilent books which Tyndale and
others send over into the realm in order to set forth
their abominable heresies. For this purpose he has
not only by his most erudite famous books, both in
English and Latin, declared his most Catholic purpose
and intent, but also by his open proclamations divers
times renewed, and finally in his own most royal
person in the Star Chamber most eloquently by his
mouth, in the presence of his lords spiritual and
temporal, has given monition and warning to all the
justices of peace of every quarter of his realm then
assembled before his Highness, to be declared by them
to all his people, and did prohibit and forbid under
great penalties, the bringing in, reading, and keep of
those pernicious poisoned books.”<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The other writers of the time, moreover, had no
doubt whatever as to the place whence the novel
opinions had sprung, and they feared that social disturbances
would follow in the wake of the religious
teaching of the sectaries as they had done in the country
of their birth. Thus Germen Gardynare, writing
to a friend about the execution of John Frith for
heresy, says that he was “amongst others found busy
at Oxford in setting abroad these heresies which lately
sprang up in Germany, and by the help of such folk
are spread abroad into sundry places of Christendom,
tending to nothing else but to the division and rending
asunder of Christ’s mystical body, His Church; and
to the pulling down of all power and the utter subversion
of all commonwealths.”<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas More, too, saw danger to the ship of
State from the storms which threatened the nation in
the rise of the religious novelties imported from abroad.
As a warning anticipation of what might come to pass
in England if the flood was allowed to gain head, he
describes what was known of the state of Germany
when he wrote in 1528. What helped Luther to successfully
spread his poison was, he says, “that liberty
which he so highly commended unto the people,
inducing them to believe that having faith they
needed nothing else. For he taught them to neglect
fasting, prayer, and such other things as vain and unfruitful
ceremonies, teaching them also that being faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Christians they were so near cousins to Christ that
they were, in a full freedom and liberty, discharged of
all governors and all manner of laws spiritual and temporal,
except only the Gospel. And though he said that,
as a point of special perfection, it would be good to
suffer and bear the rule and authority of Popes and
princes and other governors, whose rule and authority
he calls mere tyranny, yet he says the people are so
free by faith that they are no more bound thereto than
they are to suffer wrong. And this doctrine Tyndale
also teaches as the special matter of his holy book of
disobedience. Now, this doctrine was heard so pleasantly
in Germany by the common people that it
blinded them in looking on the remnant, and would
not allow them to consider and see what end the same
would come to. The temporal lords also were glad to
hear this talk against the clergy, and the people were as
glad to hear it against the clergy and against the lords
too, and against all the governors of every good town and
city. Finally, it went so far that it began to burst out
and fall to open force and violence. For intending to
begin at the most feeble, a boisterous company of the
unhappy sect gathered together and first rebelled
against an abbot, and afterwards against a bishop,
wherewith the temporal lords had good game and
sport and dissembled the matter, gaping after the
lands of the spirituality, till they had almost played
as Æsop tells of the dog, which, in order to snatch
at the shadow of the cheese in the water, let the cheese
he had in his mouth fall, and lost it. For so it was
shortly after that those uplandish Lutherans took so
great boldness and began to grow so strong that they
set also upon the temporal lords. These … so acquitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
themselves that they slew in one summer 70,000
Lutherans and subdued the rest in that part of Germany
to a most miserable servitude.… And in divers other
parts of Germany and Switzerland this ungracious sect
is so grown, by the negligence of governors in great
cities, that in the end the common people have compelled
the rulers to follow them.…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now it is too piteous a sight to see the ‘dispiteous
dispyghts’ done in many places to God and all
good men, with the marvellous change from the face
and fashion of Christendom into a very tyrannous persecution,
not only of all good Christians living and dead,
but also of Christ Himself. For there you will see
now goodly monasteries destroyed, the places burnt
up, and the religious people put out and sent to
seek their living; or, in many cities, the places (the
buildings) yet standing with more despite to God than
if they were burned to ashes. For the religious people,
monks, friars, and nuns, are wholly driven or drawn
out, except such as would agree to forsake their vows
of chastity and be wedded; and places dedicated to
cleanliness and chastity, left only to these apostates as
brothels to live there in lechery. Now are the parish
churches in many places not only defaced, all the ornaments
taken away, the holy images pulled down, and
either broken or burned, but also the Holy Sacrament
cast out. And the abominable beasts (which I abhor
to think about) did not abhor in despite to defile the
pixes and in many places use the churches continually
for a common siege. And that they have done in so
despiteful a wise that when a stranger from other places
where Christ is worshipped resorts to these cities, some
of those unhappy wretched citizens do not fail, as it
were, for courtesy and kindness, to accompany them in
their walking abroad to show them the pleasures and
commodities of the town, and then bring them to the
church, only to show them in derision what uses the
churches serve for!” Then, after pointing out that “of
this sect were the greater part of those ungracious
people who lately entered into Rome with the Duke
of Bourbon,” Sir Thomas More details at considerable
length the horrors committed during that sack
of the Eternal City; adding: “For this purpose I
rehearse to you these their heavy mischievous dealings,
that you may perceive by their deeds what good comes
of their sect. For as our Saviour says: ‘ye shall
know the tree by the fruit.’”<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The activity of the teachers of the new doctrine
was everywhere remarkable. More only wished that
the maintainers of the traditional Catholic faith were
half so zealous “as those that are fallen into false
heresies and have forsaken the faith.” These seem,
he says, indeed to “have a hot fire of hell in their
hearts that can never suffer them to rest or cease,
but forces them night and day to labour and work
busily to subvert and destroy the Catholic Christian
faith by every means they can devise.”<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The time
was, “and even until now very late,” when no man
would allow any heresy to be spoken at his table; for
this “has been till of late the common Christian zeal
towards the Catholic faith.” But now (1533)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> “though,
God be thanked, the faith is itself as fast rooted in this
realm as ever it was before (except in some very few
places, and yet even in those few the very faithful folk
are many more than the faithless), even good men
are beginning to tolerate the discussion of heretical
views, and to take part in ‘the evil talk.’”</p>

<p>To understand the Reformation in England, it is
important to note the progress of its growth, and to
note that the lines upon which it developed were to
all intents and purposes those which had been laid
down by Luther for the German religious revolution,
although, in many ways, England was carried along the
path of reformed doctrines, even further than the original
leader had been prepared to go. The special points
of the traditional faith of the English people, which the
reforming party successfully attacked, were precisely
those which had been the battle-ground in Germany,
and Sir Thomas More’s description of the result there
might somewhat later have been written of this country.
Tyndale was described by More as “the captain of
the English heretics,” and the influence of his works
no doubt greatly helped to the overthrow of the traditional
teaching. The key of the position taken up by
the English Reformers, as well as by their German
predecessors, was the claim that all belief must be
determined by the plain word of Holy Scripture, and
by that alone. Tradition they rejected, although Sir
Thomas More pointed out forcibly that the Church
had always acknowledged the twofold authority of the
written and unwritten word.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Upon this ground
Tyndale and his successors rejected all the sacraments
but two, attacked popular devotion to sacred images
and prayers to our Lady and the saints, and rejected
the old teaching about Purgatory and the help the
souls of the departed faithful could derive from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
suffrages and penances of the living. Confirmation
and the anointing of priests at ordination they contemptuously
called “butter smearing,” and with their
denial of the priesthood quickly came their rejection
of the doctrine of the Sacrifice in the Mass, and their
teaching that the Holy Eucharist is a “token and
sign” rather than the actual Body and Blood of our
Lord.</p>

<p>No means were left untried to further the spread
of the new views. Books of prayer were drawn up, in
which, under the guise of familiar devotions, the poison
of the reformed doctrine was unsuspectedly imbibed.
Richard Whitford complains that his works, which just
on the eve of the Reformation were deservedly popular,
had been made use of for the purpose of interpolating
tracts against points of Catholic faith, which people were
induced to buy under the supposition that they were
from the pen of the celebrated monk of Sion. John
Waylande, the printer of some Whitford books, in 1537
prefixed the following notice to the new edition of
the <i>Werke for Householders</i>. “The said author required
me instantly that I should not print nor join any other
works with his, specially of uncertain authors. For
of late he found a work joined in the same volume
with his works, and bought and taken for his work.
This was not his, but was put there instead of his work
that before was named among the contents of his book,
and yet his (real) work was left out, as is complained in
this preface here unto the Reader.”</p>

<p>In his preface Whitford says that the substituted
work was obviously by one of the Reformers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> “not
only puts me into infamy and slander, but also puts
all readers in jeopardy of conscience to be infected
(by heresy) and in danger of the king’s laws, for the
manifold erroneous opinions that are contained in the
same book.” He consequently adds a warning to his
readers: “By my poor advice,” he says, “read not
those books that go forth without named authors.
For, doubtless, many of them that seem very devout
and good works, are full of heresies, and your old
English poet says, ‘There is no poison so perilous
of sharpness as that is that hath of sugar a sweetness.’”<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>In a subsequent volume, published in 1541, called
<i>Dyvers holy instructions and teachings</i>, Whitford again complains
of this device of the teachers of the new doctrines.
In the preface he gives the exact titles of the four little
tracts which go to make up the volume, in order, as he
says, “to give you warning to search well and surely
that no other works are put amongst them that might
deceive you. For, of a certainty, I found now but
very lately a work joined and bound with my poor
labours and under the contents of the same volume,
and one of my works which was named in the same
contents left out. Instead of this, was put this other
work that was not mine. For the title of mine was
this, ‘A daily exercise and experience of death,’ and
the other work has no name of any author. And all
such works in this time are ever to be suspected, for
so the heretics are used to send forth their poison
among the people covered with sugar. For they seem
to be good and devout workers, and are in very deed
stark heresies.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Even the smallest points were not deemed too insignificant
for the teaching of novel doctrines destructive
of the old Catholic spirit. To take an example:
John Standish, writing in Mary’s reign about the vernacular
Scripture, complains of the translation which
had been made in the time of Henry VIII. “Who is
able,” he writes, “to tell at first sight how many
hundred faults are even in their best translation (if
there is any good). Shall they be suffered still to
continue? Shall they still poison more like as they
do in a thousand damnable English books set forth
within the last twenty-two years? Lord deliver us
from them all, and that with all speed! I take God
to record (if I may speak only of one fault in the
translation and touch no more) my heart did ever
abhor to hear this word <i>Dominus</i> … translated <i>the</i>
Lord, whereas it ought to be translated <i>our</i> Lord, the
very Latin phrase so declaring. Is not St. John
saying to Peter (John, xxi.), <i>Dominus est</i>, ‘it is our
Lord’? whereas they have falsely translated it as in
many other places ‘<i>the</i> Lord.’ And likewise in the
salutation of our Lady, ‘Hail, Mary, full of grace,
<i>dominus tecum</i>,’ does not this word <i>dominus</i> here include
<i>noster</i>, and so ought to be translated ‘our Lord is with
thee’? Would you make the Archangel like a devil
call him <i>the</i> Lord? He is the Lord to every evil spirit,
but to us He is our most merciful Lord and ought to
be called so. If, perchance, you ask of a husbandman
whose ground that is, he will answer, ‘the lord’s,’ who
is perhaps no better than a collier. Well, I speak this,
not now so much for the translation, seeing that it
swarms as full of faults as leaves (I will not say lines)
as I do, because I wish that the common speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
among people sprung from this fond translation, ‘I
thank the Lord’; ‘the Lord be praised’; ‘the Lord
knoweth’; with all such-like phrases might be given
up, and that the people might be taught to call Him
‘our Lord,’ saying, ‘I thank our Lord’; ‘our Lord
be praised,’<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PRINTED ENGLISH BIBLE</span></h2>

<p>It is very commonly believed that until the influence
of Cranmer had made itself felt, the ecclesiastical
authorities continued to maintain the traditionally
hostile attitude of the English Church towards the
English Bible. In proof of this, writers point to the
condemnation of the translations issued by Tyndale,
and the wholesale destruction of all copies of this, the
first printed edition of the English New Testament.
It is consequently of importance to examine into the
extent of the supposed clerical hostility to the vernacular
Scriptures, and into the reasons assigned by those
having the conduct of ecclesiastical affairs at that
period for the prohibition of Tyndale’s Testament.</p>

<p>It may not be without utility to point out that the
existence of any determination on the part of the
Church to prevent the circulation of vernacular Bibles
in the fifteenth century has been hitherto too hastily
assumed. Those who were living during that period
may be fairly considered the most fitting interpreters
of the prohibition of Archbishop Arundel, which has
been so frequently adduced as sufficient evidence of
this supposed uncompromising hostility to what is now
called “the open Bible.” The terms of the archbishop’s
monition do not, on examination, bear the meaning
usually put upon it; and should the language be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
by some obscure, there is absolute evidence of
the possession of vernacular Bibles by Catholics of
undoubted orthodoxy with, at the very least, the tacit
consent of the ecclesiastical authorities. When to this
is added the fact that texts from the then known
English Scriptures were painted on the walls of churches,
and portions of the various books were used in authorised
manuals of prayer, it is impossible to doubt that
the hostility of the English Church to the vernacular
Bible has been greatly exaggerated, if indeed its attitude
has not altogether been misunderstood. This much
may, and indeed must, be conceded, wholly apart from
the further question whether the particular version now
known as the Wycliffite Scriptures is, or is not, the
version used in the fifteenth and early sixteenth century
by Catholic Englishmen. That a Catholic version, or
some version viewed as Catholic and orthodox by those
who lived in the sixteenth century, really existed does
not admit of any doubt at all on the distinct testimony
of Sir Thomas More. It will be readily admitted that
he was no ordinary witness. As one eminent in legal
matters, he must be supposed to know the value of
evidence, and his uncompromising attitude towards all
innovators in matters of religion is a sufficient guarantee
that he would be no party to the propagation of any
unorthodox or unauthorised translations.</p>

<p>Some quotations from Sir Thomas More’s works
will illustrate his belief better than any lengthy exposition.
It is unnecessary, he says, to defend the law
prohibiting any English version of the Bible, “for there
is none such, indeed. There is of truth a Constitution
which speaks of this matter, but nothing of such fashion.
For you shall understand that the great arch-heretic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Wycliffe, whereas the whole Bible was long before his
days by virtuous and well-learned men translated into
the English tongue, and by good and godly people and
with devotion and soberness well and reverently read,
took upon himself to translate it anew. In this translation
he purposely corrupted the holy text, maliciously
planting in it such words, as might in the readers’ ears
serve to prove such heresies as he ‘went about’ to sow.
These he not only set forth with his own translation of
the Bible, but also with certain prologues and glosses
he made upon it, and he so managed this matter, assigning
probable and likely reasons suitable for lay and unlearned
people, that he corrupted in his time many folk
in this realm.…</p>

<p>“After it was seen what harm the people took from
the translation, prologues, and glosses of Wycliffe and
also of some others, who after him helped to set forth
his sect for that cause, and also for as much as it is
dangerous to translate the text of Scripture out of one
tongue into another, as St. Jerome testifieth, since in
translating it is hard to keep the same sentence whole
(i.e. the exact meaning): it was, I say, for these causes
at a Council held at Oxford, ordered under great penalties
that no one might thenceforth translate (the Scripture)
into English, or any other language, on his own
authority, in a book, booklet, or tract, and that no one
might read openly or secretly any such book, booklet,
or treatise newly made in the time of the said John
Wycliffe, or since, or should be made any time after, till
the same translation had been approved by the diocesan,
or, if need should require, by a Provincial Council.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
<p>“This is the law that so many have so long spoken
about, and so few have all this time sought to look
whether they say the truth or not. For I hope you see
in this law nothing unreasonable, since it neither forbids
good translations to be read that were already made of
old before Wycliffe’s time, nor condemns his because it
was new, but because it was ‘naught.’ Neither does it
prohibit new translations to be made, but provides that
if they are badly made they shall not be read till they
are thoroughly examined and corrected, unless indeed
they are such translations as Wycliffe and Tyndale made,
which the malicious mind of the translator has handled
in such a way that it were labour lost to try and correct
them.”</p>

<p>The “objector,” whom Sir Thomas More was engaged
in instructing in the <i>Dialogue</i>, could hardly believe
that the formal Provincial Constitution meant nothing
more than this, and thereupon, as Sir Thomas says: “I
set before him the Constitutions Provincial, with Lyndwood
upon it, and directed him to the place under the
title <i>De magistris</i>. When he himself had read this, he
said he marvelled greatly how it happened that in so
plain a matter men were so deceived.” But he thought
that even if the law was not as he had supposed, nevertheless
the clergy acted as if it were, and always “took
all translations out of every man’s hand whether the
translation was good or bad, old or new.” To this
More replied that to his knowledge this was not correct.
“I myself,” he says, “have seen and can show you
Bibles, fair and old, written in English, which have been
known and seen by the bishop of the diocese, and left in
the hands of laymen and women, whom he knew to be
good and Catholic people who used the books with
devotion and soberness.” He admitted indeed that all
Bibles found in the hands of heretics were taken away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
from them, but none of these, so far as he had ever
heard, were burnt, except such as were found to be
garbled and false. Such were the Bibles issued with
evil prologues or glosses, maliciously made by Wycliffe
and other heretics. “Further,” he declared, “no good
man would be so mad as to burn a Bible in which they
found no fault.” Nor was there any law whatever that
prohibited the possession, examination, or reading of
the Holy Scripture in English.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>In reply to the case of Richard Hunn, who, according
to the story set about by the religious innovators,
had been condemned and his dead body burnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> “only
because they found English Bibles in his house, in
which they never found other fault than because they
were in English,” Sir Thomas More, professedly, and
with full knowledge of the circumstances, absolutely
denies, as he says, “from top to toe,” the truth of this
story.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> He shows at great length that the whole tale
of Hunn’s death was carefully examined into by the
king’s officials, and declares that at many of the examinations
he himself had been present and heard the
witnesses, and that in the end it had been fully shown
that Hunn was in reality a heretic and a teacher of
heresy. “But,” urged his objector, “though Hunn
were himself a heretic, yet might the book (of the
English Bible) be good enough; and there is no good
reason why a good book should be burnt.” The copy
of this Bible, replied More, was of great use in showing
the kind of man Hunn really was, “for at the time he
was denounced as a heretic, there lay his English Bible
open, and some other English books of his, so that
every one could see the places noted with his own hand,
such words and in such a way that no wise and good
man could, after seeing them, doubt what ‘naughty
minds’ the men had, both he that so noted them and
he that so made them. I do not remember the particulars,”
he continued, “nor the formal words as they
were written, but this I do remember well, that besides
other things found to support divers other heresies,
there were in the prologue of that Bible such words
touching the Blessed Sacrament as good Christian men
did much abhor to hear, and which gave the readers undoubted
occasion to think that the book was written
after Wycliffe’s copy, and by him translated into our
tongue.”<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>More then goes on to state his own mind as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
utility of vernacular Scriptures. And, in the first place,
he utterly denies again that the Church, or any ecclesiastical
authority, ever kept the Bible in English from
the people, except “such translations as were either not
approved as good translations, or such as had already
been condemned as false, such as Wycliffe’s and Tyndale’s
were. For, as for other old ones that were before
Wycliffe’s days, they remain lawful, and are in the possession
of some people, and are read.” To this assertion
of a plain fact Sir Thomas More’s opponent did
not dissent, but frankly admitted that this was certainly
the case,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> although he still thought that the English
Bible might be in greater circulation than it was.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Sir
Thomas More considered that the clergy really had
good grounds not to encourage the spread of the vernacular
Scriptures at that time, inasmuch as those who
were most urgent in the matter were precisely those
whose orthodoxy was reasonably suspected. It made
men fear, he says, “that seditious people would do
more harm with it than good and honest folk would
derive benefit.” This, however, he declared was not
his own personal view.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> “I would not,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
“for my part, withhold the profit that one good, devout,
unlearned man might get by the reading, for fear of the
harm a hundred heretics might take by their own wilful
abuse.… Finally, I think that the Provincial Constitution
(already spoken of) has long ago determined
the question. For when the clergy in that synod agreed
that the English Bibles should remain which were translated
before Wycliffe’s days, they, as a necessary consequence,
agreed that it was no harm to have the Bible
in English. And when they forbade any new translation
to be read till it were approved by the bishops, it
appears clearly that they intended that the bishop should
approve it, if he found it to be faultless, and also to
amend it where it was found faulty, unless the man
who made it was a heretic, or the faults were so many
and of such a character that it would be easier to retranslate
it than to mend it.”<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>This absolute denial of any attitude of hostility on
the part of the Church to the translated Bible is reiterated
in many parts of Sir Thomas More’s English
works. When, upon the condemnation of Tyndale’s
Testament, the author pointed to this fact as proof of
the determination of the clergy to keep the Word of God
from the people, More replied at considerable length.
He showed how the ground of the condemnation had
nothing whatever to do with any anxiety upon the part of
ecclesiastics to keep the Scriptures from lay people, but
was entirely based upon the complete falsity of Tyndale’s
translation itself. “He pretends,” says Sir Thomas
More,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> “that the Church makes some (statutes) openly
and directly against the Word of God, as in that statute
whereby they have condemned the New Testament.
Now, in truth, there is no such statute made. For
as for the New Testament, if he mean the Testament
of Christ, it is not condemned nor forbidden.
But there is forbidden a false English
translation of the New Testament newly forged by
Tyndale, altered and changed in matters of great weight,
in order maliciously to set forth against Christ’s true
doctrine Tyndale’s anti-Christian heresies. Therefore
that book is condemned, as it is well worthy to be, and
the condemnation thereof is neither openly nor privily,
directly nor indirectly, against the word of God.”<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Again, in another place, More replies to what he
calls Tyndale’s “railing” against the clergy, and in particular
his saying that they keep the Scripture from lay
people in order that they may not see how they
“juggle with it.” “I have,” he says, “in the book of
my <i>Dyalogue</i> proved already that Tyndale in this point
falsely belies the clergy, and that in truth Wycliffe,
and Tyndale, and Friar Barnes, and such others, have
been the original cause why the Scripture has been of
necessity kept out of lay people’s hands. And of late,
specially, by the politic provision and ordinance of our
most excellent sovereign the king’s noble grace, not
without great and urgent causes manifestly rising from
the false malicious means of Wycliffe and Tyndale,” this
has been prevented. “For this (attempt of Tyndale)
all the lay people of this realm, both the evil folk who
take harm from him, and the good folk that lose their
profit by him, have great cause to lament that ever the
man was born.”<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>The same view is taken by Roger Edgworth, a
popular preacher in the reign of Henry VIII. After
describing what he considered to be the evils which
had resulted from the spread of Lutheran literature in
England, he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> “By this effect you may judge the
cause. The effect was evil, therefore there must needs
be some fault in the cause. But what sayest thou? Is
not the study of Scripture good? Is not the knowledge
of the Gospels and of the New Testament godly,
good, and profitable for a Christian man or woman?
I shall tell you what I think in this matter. I have
ever been in this mind, that I have thought it no harm,
but rather good and profitable, that Holy Scripture
should be had in the mother tongue, and withheld from
no man that was apt and meet to take it in hand,
specially if we could get it well and truly translated,
which will be very hard to be had.”<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>There is, it is true, no doubt, that the destruction of
Tyndale’s Testaments and the increasing number of
those who favoured the new religious opinions, caused
people to spread all manner of stories abroad as to the
attitude of the Church authorities in England towards
the vernacular Scriptures. Probably the declaration
of the friend, against whom Sir Thomas More, then
Chancellor, in 1530, wrote his <i>Dyalogue</i>, “that great
murmurs were heard against the clergy on this score,”
is not far from the truth. Ecclesiastics, he said, in the
opinion of the common people, would not tolerate
criticism of their lives or words, and desired to keep
laymen ignorant. “And they” (the people) “think,”
he adds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> “that for no other cause was there burned at
St. Paul’s Cross the New Testament, late translated by
Master William Huchin, otherwise called Tyndale, who
was (as men say) well known, before he went over the
sea, as a man of right good life, studious and well
learned in the Scriptures. And men mutter among
themselves that the book was not only faultless, but
also very well translated, and was ordered to be burned,
because men should not be able to prove that such
faults (as were at Paul’s Cross declared to have been
found in it) were never in fact found there at all; but
untruly surmised, in order to have some just cause
to burn it, and that for no other reason than to keep
out of the people’s hands all knowledge of Christ’s
Gospel and of God’s law, except so much as the clergy
themselves please now and then to tell them. Further,
that little as this is, it is seldom expounded. And, as it
is feared, even this is not well and truly told; but
watered with false glosses and altered from the truth
of the words and meaning of Scripture, only to maintain
the clerical authority. And the fear lest this
should appear evident to the people, if they were
suffered to read the Scripture themselves in their own
tongue, was (it is thought) the very cause, not only
for which the New Testament translated by Tyndale
was burned, but also why the clergy of this realm have
before this time, by a Constitution Provincial, prohibited
any book of Scripture to be translated into the English
tongue, and threaten with fire men who should presume
to keep them, as heretics; as though it were heresy
for a Christian man to read Christ’s Gospel.”<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>It has been already pointed out how Sir Thomas
More completely disposed of this assertion as to the
hostility of the clergy to “the open Bible.” In his
position of Chancellor of England, More could hardly
have been able to speak with so much certainty about
the real attitude of the Church, had not the true facts
been at the same time well understood and commonly
acknowledged. The words of the “objector,” however,
not only express the murmurs of those who were at that
period discontented with the ecclesiastical system; but
they voice the accusations which have been so frequently
made from that day to this, by those who do
not as a fact look at the other side. Sir Thomas More’s
testimony proves absolutely that no such hostility to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
English Bible as is so generally assumed of the pre-Reformation
Church did, in fact, exist. Most certainly
there never was any ecclesiastical prohibition against
vernacular versions as such, and the most orthodox
sons of the Church did in fact possess copies of the
English Scriptures, which they read openly and devoutly.
This much seems certain.</p>

<p>Moreover, Sir Thomas More’s contention that there
was no prohibition is borne out by other evidence.
The great canonist Lyndwood undoubtedly understood
the Constitution of Oxford on the Scriptures in the
same sense as Sir Thomas More. In fact, as it has
been pointed out already, to his explanation Sir
Thomas More successfully appealed in proof of his
assertion that there was no such condemnation of the
English Scriptures, as had been, and is still, asserted
by some. It has, of course, been often said that Sir
Thomas More, and of course Lyndwood, were wrong
in supposing that there were any translations previous
to that of the version now known as Wycliffite.
This is by no means so clear; and even supposing
they were in error as to the date of the version, it is
impossible that they could have been wrong as to the
meaning and interpretation of the law itself, and as
to the fact that versions were certainly in circulation
which were presumed by those who used them
to be Catholic and orthodox. Archbishop Cranmer
himself may also be cited as a witness to the free
circulation of manuscript copies of the English Scriptures
in pre-Reformation times, since the whole of his
argument for allowing a new version, in the preface to
the Bishops’ Bible, rests on the well-known custom
of the Church to allow vernacular versions, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
fact that copies of the English Scriptures had previously
been in daily use with ecclesiastical sanction.</p>

<p>The same conclusion must be deduced from books
printed by men of authority and unquestionable piety.
In them we find the reading of the Scriptures strongly
recommended. To take an example: Thomas Lupset,
the friend and protégé of Colet and Lilly, gives the
following advice to his sisters, two of whom were nuns:
“Give thee much to reading; take heed in meditation
of the Scripture, busy thee in the law of God; have
a customable use in divine books.”<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The same pious
scholar has much the same advice for a youth in the
world who had been his pupil. After urging him to
avoid “meddling in any point of faith otherwise than
as the Church shall instruct and teach,” he adds, “more
particularly in writings you shall learn this lesson, if you
would sometimes take in your hand the New Testament
and read it with a due reverence”; and again: “in
reading the Gospels, I would you had at hand Chrysostom
and Jerome, by whom you might surely be brought
to a perfect understanding of the text.”<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the testimony of Sir Thomas More that
translations were allowed by the Church, and that these,
men considered rightly or wrongly, had been made
prior to the time of Wycliffe, is confirmed by Archdeacon
John Standish in Queen Mary’s reign. When the
question of the advisability of a vernacular translation
was then seriously debated, he says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> “To the intent
that none should have occasion to misconstrue the true
meaning thereof, it is to be thought that, if all men
were good and Catholic, then were it lawful, yea, and
very profitable also, that the Scripture should be in
English, as long as the translations were true and
faithful.… And that is the cause that the clergy
did agree (as it is in the Constitution Provincial) that
the Bibles that were translated into English before
Wycliffe’s days might be suffered; so that only such
as had them in handling were allowed by the ordinary
and approved as proper to read them, and so that their
reading should be only for the setting forth of God’s
glory.”<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas More, in his <i>Apology</i>, points out that
although, in his opinion, it would be a good thing to
have a proper English translation, still it was obviously
not necessary for the salvation of man’s soul. “If the
having of the Scripture in English,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> “be a
thing so requisite of precise necessity, that the people’s
souls must needs perish unless they have it translated
into their own tongue, then the greater part of them
must indeed perish, unless the preacher further provide
that all people shall be able to read it when they have
it. For of the whole people, far more than four-tenths
could never read English yet, and many are now too
old to begin to go to school.… Many, indeed, have
thought it a good and profitable thing to have the
Scripture well and truly translated into English, and
although many equally wise and learned and also very
virtuous folk have been and are of a very different
mind; yet, for my own part, I have been and am still
of the same opinion as I expressed in my Dyalogue,
if the people were amended, and the time meet
for it.”<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The truth is, that there was then no such clamour
for the translated Bible as it has suited the purposes of
some writers to represent. In view of all that is known
about the circumstances of those times, it does not
appear at all likely that the popular mind would be
really stirred by any desire for Bible reading. The late
Mr. Brewer may be allowed to speak with authority on
this matter when he writes: “Nor, indeed, is it possible
that Tyndale’s writings and translations could at this
early period have produced any such impressions as is
generally surmised, or have fallen into the hands of
many readers. His works were printed abroad; their
circulation was strictly forbidden; the price of them was
beyond the means of the poorer classes, even supposing
that the knowledge of letters at that time was more
generally diffused than it was for centuries afterwards.
To imagine that ploughmen and shepherds in the
country read the New Testament in English by stealth,
or that smiths and carpenters in towns pored over its
pages in the corners of their masters’ workshops, is to
mistake the character and acquirements of the age.”<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>“So far from England then being a ‘Bible-thirsty
land,’” says a well-informed writer, “there was no
anxiety whatever for an English version at that time,
excepting among a small minority of the people,”<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and
these desired it not for the thing in itself so much
as a means of bringing about the changes in doctrine
and practice which they desired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> “Who is there
among us,” says one preacher of the period, “that
will have a Bible, but he must be compelled thereto.”
And the single fact that the same edition of the Bible
was often reissued with new titles, &amp;c., is sufficient
proof that there was no such general demand for
Bibles as is pretended by Foxe when he writes: “It
was wonderful to see with what joy this book of
God was received, not only among the learneder
sort, and those that were noted for lovers of the
Reformation, but generally all England over among
all the vulgar common people.” “For,” says the
writer above quoted, “if the people all England
over were so anxious to possess the new translation,
what need was there of so many penal enactments to
force it into circulation, and of royal proclamations
threatening with the king’s displeasure those who
neglected to purchase copies.”<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the condemnation of
the first printed English Testament, and the destruction,
by order of the ecclesiastical authority, of all copies
which Tyndale had sent over to England for sale, have
tended, more than anything else, to confirm in their
opinion those who held that the Church in pre-Reformation
England would not tolerate the vernacular
Scriptures at all. It is of interest, therefore, and importance,
if we would determine the real attitude of
churchmen in the sixteenth century to the English
Bible, to understand the grounds of this condemnation.
As the question was keenly debated at the time, there
is little need to seek for information beyond the pages
of Sir Thomas More’s works.</p>

<p>The history of Tyndale’s translation is not of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
importance in this respect, as a knowledge of the chief
points objected against it. Some brief account of this
history, however, is almost necessary if we would fully
understand the character and purpose of the translation.
William Tyndale was born about the year
1484, and was in turn at Oxford and Cambridge Universities,
and professed among the Friars Observant at
Greenwich. In 1524 he passed over to Hamburg, and
then, about the middle of the year, to Wittenberg, where
he attached himself to Luther. Under the direction at
least, of the German reformer, and very possibly also
with his actual assistance, he commenced his translation
of the New Testament. The royal almoner,
Edward Lee, afterwards Archbishop of York, being
on a journey to Spain, wrote on December 2, 1525,
from Bordeaux, warning Henry VIII. of the preparation
of this book. “I am certainly informed,” he says,
“that an Englishman, your subject, at the solicitation
and instance of Luther, with whom he is, hath translated
the New Testament into English; and within a
few days intendeth to return with the same imprinted
into England. I need not to advertise your Grace
what infection and danger may ensue hereby if it be
not withstanded. This is the way to fill your realm
with Lutherans. For all Luther’s perverse opinions
be grounded upon bare words of Scripture not well
taken nor understood, which your Grace hath opened
(<i>i.e.</i> pointed out) in sundry places of your royal book.”<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s direct influence may be detected on almost
every page of the printed edition issued by Tyndale,
and there can be no doubt that it was prepared with
Luther’s version of 1522 as a guide. From the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
introduction of this German Bible, nearly half, or some
sixty lines, are transferred by Tyndale almost bodily to
his prologue, whilst he adopted and printed over against
the same chapters and verses, placing them in the same
position in the inner margins, some 190 of the German
reformer’s marginal references. Besides this, the marginal
notes on the outer margin of the English Testament
are all Luther’s glosses, translated from the
German. In view of this, it can hardly be a matter
of surprise that Tyndale’s Testament was very commonly
known at the time as “Luther’s Testament in
English.”</p>

<p>In this work of translation or adaptation, Tyndale
was assisted by another ex-friar, named Joye, with
whom, however, he subsequently quarrelled, and about
whom he then spoke in abusive and violent terms. At
first it was intended to print the edition at Cologne, but
being disturbed by the authorities there, Tyndale fled
to Worms, and at once commenced printing at the
press of Peter Schœffer, the octavo volume which is
known as the first edition of Tyndale’s New Testament.
Although the author is supposed to have been a good
Greek scholar, there is evidence to show that the copy
he used for the work of translation was the Latin version
of Erasmus, printed by Fisher in 1519, with some
alterations taken from the edition of 1522, and some
other corrections from the Vulgate.</p>

<p>John Cochlæus, who had a full and personal knowledge
of all the Lutheran movements at the time, writing
in 1533, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> “Eight years previously, two apostates
from England, knowing the German language, came
to Wittenberg, and translated Luther’s New Testament
into English. They then came to Cologne, as to a
city nearer to England, with a more established
trade, and more adapted for the despatch of merchandise.
Here … they secretly agreed with printers to
print at first three thousand copies, and printers and
publishers pushed on the work with the firm expectation
of success, boasting that whether the king and
cardinal liked it or not, England would shortly ‘be
Lutheran.’”<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>It was this scheme that Cochlæus was instrumental
in frustrating, his representations forcing Tyndale to
remove the centre of his operations to Worms. For
the benefit of the Scotch king, to whom his account was
addressed, Cochlæus adds, that Luther’s German translation
of the New Testament was intended of set
purpose to spread his errors; that the people had
bought up thousands, and that thereby “they have
not been made better but rather the worse, artificers
who were able to read neglecting their shops and
the work by which they ought to gain the bread
of their wives and children.” For this reason, he
says, magistrates in Germany have had to forbid the
reading of Luther’s Testament, and many have been put
in prison for reading it. In his opinion the translation
of the Testament into the vernacular had become an
idol and a fetish to the German Lutherans, although in
Germany there were many vernacular translations of
both the Old and the New Testaments, before the rise
of Lutheranism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>With a full understanding of the purpose and tendency
of Tyndale’s translation and of the evils which
at least some hard-headed men had attributed to the
spread of Luther’s German version, upon which almost
admittedly the English was modelled, the ecclesiastical
authorities of England approached the practical question&mdash;what
was to be done in the matter? Copies of
the printed edition must have reached England some
time in 1526, for in October of that year Bishop Tunstall
of London addressed a monition to the archdeacons
on the subject. “Many children of iniquity,”
he says, “maintainers of Luther’s sect, blinded through
extreme wickedness, wandering from the way of truth
and the Catholic faith, have craftily translated the
New Testament into our English tongue, intermeddling
therewith many heretical articles and erroneous opinions,
pernicious and offensive, seducing the simple people;
attempting by their wicked and perverse interpretations
to profane the majesty of Scripture, which hitherto hath
remained undefiled, and craftily to abuse the most holy
Word of God, and the true sense of the same. Of this
translation there are many books printed, some with
glosses and some without, containing in the English
tongue that pestiferous and pernicious poison, (and
these are) dispersed in our diocese of London.” He
consequently orders all such copies of the New Testament
to be delivered up to his offices within thirty
days.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>This was the first action of the English ecclesiastical
authorities, and it was clearly taken not from distrust
of what the same bishop calls “the most holy Word
of God,” but because they looked on the version sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
forth by Tyndale as a profanation of the Bible, and
as intended to disseminate the errors of Lutheranism.</p>

<p>Of the Lutheran character of the translation the
authorities, whether in Church or State, do not seem
to have had from the first the least doubt. The king
himself, in a rejoinder to Luther’s letter of apology,
says that the German reformer “fell in device with
one or two lewd persons, born in this our realm, for
the translating of the New Testament into English, as
well with many corruptions of that holy text, as certain
prefaces and other pestilent glosses in the margins, for
the advancement and setting forth of his abominable
heresies, intending to abuse the good minds and devotion
that you, our dearly beloved people, bear toward
the Holy Scripture and infect you with the deadly corruption
and contagious odour of his pestilent errors.”<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Tunstall, in 1529, whilst returning from an
embassy abroad, purchased at Antwerp through one
Packington, all copies of the English printed New
Testament that were for sale, and, according to the
chronicler Hall, burned them publicly at St. Paul’s
in May 1530. For the same reason the confiscated
volumes of the edition first sent over were committed
to the flames some time in 1527,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and Bishop Tunstall
explained to the people at Paul’s Cross that the book
was destroyed because in more than two thousand
places wrong translations and corruptions had been
detected. Tyndale made a great outcry at the iniquity
of burning the Word of God; but in <i>The Wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Mammon</i> he declares that, “in burning the New Testament
they did none other thynge than I looked for.”
Moreover, as he sold the books knowing the purpose
for which they were purchased, he may be said to have
been a participator in the act he blames. “The fact
is,” says a modern authority, “the books were full of
errors and unsaleable, and Tyndale wanted money to
pay the expense of a revised version and to purchase
Vastermann’s old Dutch blocks to illustrate his Pentateuch,
and was glad to make capital in more ways than
one by the translation. ‘I am glad,’ said he, ‘for these
two benefits shall come thereof: I shall get money to
bring myself out of debt, and the whole world will cry
out against the burning of God’s Word, and the overplus
of the money that shall remain to me shall make
me more studious to correct the said New Testament,
and so newly to imprint the same once again, and I
trust the second you will much better like than you
ever did the first.’”<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Tyndale allowed nine years to elapse before issuing
a second edition of his Testament. Meantime, as his
former assistant, Joye, says, foreigners looking upon the
English Testament as a good commercial speculation,
and seeing that the ecclesiastical authorities in England
had given orders to purchase the entire first issue of
Tyndale’s print, set to work to produce other reprints.
Through ignorance of the language, the various editions
they issued were naturally full of typographical errors,
and, as Joye declared, “England hath enough and too
many false Testaments, and is now likely to have many
more.” He consequently set to work himself to see
an edition through the press, in which, without Tyndal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>e’s
leave, he made substantial alterations in his translation.
Joye’s version appeared in 1534, and immediately
Tyndale attacked its editor in the most bitter, reproachful
terms. In George Joye’s <i>Apology</i>, which appeared
in 1535, he tried, as he says, “to defend himself against
so many slanderous lies upon him in Tyndale’s uncharitable
and unsober epistle.” In the course of the
tract, Joye charges Tyndale with claiming as his own
what in reality was Luther’s. “I have never,” he says,
“heard a sober, wise man praise his own works as I
have heard him praise his exposition of the fifth, sixth,
and seventh chapters of St. Matthew, insomuch that
mine ears glowed for shame to hear him; and yet it
was Luther that made it, Tyndale only translating it
and powdering it here and there with his own fantasies.”</p>

<p>In a second publication Joye declares Tyndale’s
incompetence to judge of the original Greek. “I
wonder,” he says, “how he could compare it with the
Greek, since he himself is not so exquisitely seen therein.…
I know well (he) was not able to do it without such
a helper as he hath ever had hitherto.”<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Tyndale, however,
continued his work of revision in spite of opposition,
and further, with the aid of Miles Coverdale,
issued translations of various portions of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Shortly after the public burning of the copies of
the translated Testament by Bishop Tunstall, on May
24, 1530, an assembly was called together by Archbishop
Warham to formally condemn these and other
books then being circulated with the intention of undermining
the religion of the country. The king was
present in person, and a list of errors was drawn up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and condemned “with all the books containing the
same, with the translation also of Scripture corrupted
by William Tyndale, as well in the Old Testament as in
the New.” After this meeting, a document was issued
with the king’s authority, which preachers were required
to read to their people. After speaking of the books
condemned for teaching error, the paper takes notice
of an opinion “in some of his subjects” that the Scripture
should be allowed in English. The king declares
that it is a good thing the Scriptures should be circulated
at certain times, but that there are others when
they should not be generally allowed, and taking into
consideration all the then existing circumstances, he
“thinketh in his conscience that the divulging of the
Scripture at this time in the English tongue to be committed
to the people … would rather be to their
further confusion and destruction than for the edification
of their souls.”</p>

<p>In this opinion, we are told, all in the assembly
concurred. At the same time, however, the king promised
that he would have the New Testament “faithfully
and purely translated by the most learned men,”
ready to be distributed when circumstances might
allow.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More plainly states the reason for this
prohibition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> “In these days, in which Tyndale (God
amend him) has so sore poisoned malicious and new-fangled
folk with the infectious contagion of his heresies,
the king’s highness, and not without the counsel and
advice, not only of his nobles with his other counsellors
attending upon his Grace’s person, but also of the most
virtuous and learned men of both universities and other
parts of the realm, specially called thereto, has been
obliged for the time to prohibit the Scriptures of God
to be allowed in the English tongue in the hands of
the people, lest evil folk … may turn all the honey
into poison, and do hurt unto themselves, and spread
also the infection further abroad … and by their
own fault misconstrue and take harm from the very
Scripture of God.”<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Early in 1534 Tyndale took up his abode once
more in Antwerp at the house of an English merchant,
and busied himself in passing his revised New Testament
through the press. This was published in the
following November. To it he prefixed a second prologue
dealing with the edition just published by George
Joye. This he declares was no true translation, and
charges his former assistant with deliberate falsification
of the text of Holy Scripture in order to support his
errors and false opinions. The edition itself manifests
many changes in the text caused by the criticism to
which the former impression had been subjected, whilst
many of the marginal notes “exhibit the great change
that had taken place in Tyndale’s religious opinions,
and show that he had ceased to be an Episcopalian.”<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Having given a brief outline of the history of Tyndale’s
Testament, we are now in a position to examine into
the grounds upon which the ecclesiastical authorities of
England condemned it. For this purpose, we need
again hardly go beyond the works of Sir Thomas More,
who in several of his tracts deals specifically with this
subject. “Tyndale’s false translation of the New Testament,”
he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> “was, as he himself confesses, translated
with such changes as he has made in it purposely, to
the intent that by those changed words the people
should be led into the opinions which he himself calls
true Catholic faith, but which all true Catholic people
call very false and pestilent heresies.” After saying
that for this reason this translation was rightly condemned
by the clergy and openly burnt at Paul’s Cross,
he continues: “The faults are so many in Tyndale’s translation
of the New Testament, and so spread throughout
the whole book, that it were as easy to weave a new
web of cloth or to sew up every hole in a net, so would
it be less labour to translate the whole book anew than
to make in his translation as many changes as there
needs must be before it were made a good translation.
Besides this, no wise man, I fancy, would take bread
which he well knew had once been poisoned by his
enemy’s hand, even though he saw his friend afterwards
sweep it ever so clean.… For when it had
been examined, considered, and condemned by those to
whom the judgment and ordering of the thing belonged,
and that false poisoned translation had been forbidden
to the people,” it would be the height of presumption for
any one to encourage the people boldly to resist their
prince and disobey their prelates, and give them, as some
indeed have, such a poor reason as this, “that poisoned
bread is better than no bread.”<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Further, in speaking with sorrow of the flood of
heretical literature which seemed ever growing in volume,
Sir Thomas More writes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> “Besides the works in Latin,
French, and German, there are made in the English
tongue, first, Tyndale’s New Testament, father of them
all, because of his false translations, and after that the
five books of Moses, translated by the same man, we
need not doubt in what manner, when we know by
whom and for what purpose. Then you have his introduction
to St. Paul’s Epistle, with which he introduces
his readers to a false understanding of St. Paul,
making them, among many other heresies, believe that
St. Paul held that faith alone was sufficient for salvation,
and that men’s good works were worth nothing
and could deserve no reward in heaven, though they
were done in grace.”<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Again, he says: “In the beginning of my <i>Dyalogue</i>,
I have shown that Tyndale’s translation of the New
Testament deserved to be burnt, because itself showed
that he had translated it with an evil mind, and in such
a way that it might serve him as the best means of
teaching such heresies as he had learnt from Luther,
and intended to send over hither and spread abroad
within this realm. To the truth of my assertion, Tyndale
and his fellows have so openly testified that I need
in this matter no further defence. For every man sees
that there was never any English heretical book sent
here since, in which one item of their complaint has not
been the burning of Tyndale’s Testament. For of a surety
they thought in the first place that his translation, with
their further false construction, would be the bass and
the tenor wherever they would sing the treble with
much false descant.”<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>To take some instances of the false translations to
which More reasonably objects: First, Tyndale substitutes
for <i>Church</i> the word <i>Congregation</i>, “a word with
no more signification in Christendom than among the
Jews or Turks.” After protesting that Tyndale has no
right to change the signification of a word, as, for example,
to speak of “a football,” and to mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> “the world,”
More continues: “Most certainly the word <i>Congregation</i>,
taken in conjunction with the text, would not, when he
translated it first, have served to make the English
reader understand by it the Church any more than
when he uses the word <i>idols</i> for <i>images</i>, or <i>images</i> for
<i>idols</i>, or the word <i>repenting</i> for <i>doing penance</i>, which he
also does. And indeed he has since added to his translation
certain notes, viz., that the order of the priesthood
is really nothing, but that every man, woman, and child
is a priest as much as a real priest, and that every man
and woman may consecrate the body of Christ, and say
mass as well as a priest, and hear confessions and
absolve as well as a priest can; and that there is no
difference between priests and other folks, but that all
are one congregation and company without any difference,
save appointment to preach.”</p>

<p>This enables men to understand “what Tyndale
means by using the word <i>Congregation</i> in his translation
in place of <i>Church</i>. They also see clearly by these circumstances
that he purposely changed the word to set
forth these his heresies, though he will say he takes
them for no heresies. But, on the other hand, all good
and faithful people do, and therefore they call the
Church the Church still, and will not agree to change
the old <i>Church</i> for his new <i>Congregation</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>In reply to Tyndale’s claim to be able to use the
word <i>Congregation</i> to signify the <i>Church</i>, More declares
that words must be used in their ordinary signification.
“I say,” he writes, “that this is true of the usual
signification of these words in the English tongue, by
the common custom of us English people that now
use these words in our language, or have used them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
before our days. And I say that this common custom
and usage of speech is the only way by which we know
the right and proper signification of any word. So
much so that if a word were taken from Latin, French,
or Spanish, and from lack of understanding the tongue
from which it came, was used in English for something
else than it signified in the other tongue; then in England,
whatsoever it meant anywhere else, it means only
what we understand it. Then, I say, that in England
this word <i>Congregation</i> never did signify the body of
Christian people … any more than the word <i>assembly</i>,
which has been taken from French … as
<i>congregation</i> is from the Latin.… I say now that
the word Church never has been used to signify in
the ordinary speech of this realm, any other than the
body of all those that are christened. For this reason,
and more especially because of Tyndale’s evil intent, I
said, and still say, that he did wrong to change <i>Church</i>
for <i>Congregation</i>; a holy word for a profane one, so far
as they have signification in our English tongue, into
which Tyndale made his translation.…<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>
<p>“If Tyndale had done it either accidentally, or purposely
merely for pleasure, and not with an evil intent,
I would never have said a word against it. But inasmuch
as I perceive that he has been with Luther, and
was there at the time when he so translated it, and
because I knew well the malicious heresies that Luther
had begun to bring forth, I must needs mistrust him in
this change. And now I say that even from his own
words here spoken, you may perceive his cankered
mind in his translation, for he says that Demetrius
had gathered a company against Paul for preaching
against <i>images</i>. Here the Christian reader may easily
perceive the poison of this serpent. Every one knows
that all good Christian people abhor the idols of the
false pagan gods, and also honour the images of Christ
and our Lady, and other holy saints. And as they call
the one sort images, so they call the other sort idols.
Now, whereas St. Paul preached against idols, this good
man comes and says he preached against images. And
as he here speaks, even so he translates, for in the 15th
chapter of St. Paul to the Corinthians, where St. Paul
says, ‘I have written to you that ye company not
together … if any that is called a brother be … a
worshipper of <i>idols’</i>&mdash;there Tyndale translates worshipper
of <i>images</i>. Because he would have it seem
that the Apostle had in that place forbidden Christian
men to worship images.… Here you may see the
sincerity and plain meaning of this man’s translation.”<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>…</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p>“As he falsely translated <i>Ecclesia</i> into the unknown
word <i>congregation</i>, in places where he should have translated
it into the known word of <i>holy Church</i>, and this
with a malicious purpose to set forth his heresy of the
secret and unknown church wherein is neither good
works nor sacraments, in like manner is it now proved,
in the same way and with like malice, he has translated
<i>idols</i> into <i>images</i> … to make it seem that Scripture
reprobates the goodly images of our Saviour Himself
and His holy saints.… Then he asks me why I have
not contended with Erasmus whom he calls my darling,
for translating this word <i>Ecclesia</i> into the word
<i>congregatio</i>.… I have not contended with Erasmus,
my darling, because I found no such malicious intent
with Erasmus, my darling, as I found with Tyndale;
for had I found with Erasmus, my darling, the cunning
intent and purpose that I found with Tyndale, Erasmus,
my darling, should be no more ‘my darling.’ But I
find in Erasmus, my darling, that he detests and abhors
the errors and heresies that Tyndale plainly teaches and
abides by, and therefore Erasmus, my darling, shall be
my darling still.… For his translation of <i>Ecclesia</i> by
<i>congregatio</i> is nothing like Tyndale’s, for the Latin
tongue had no Latin word used for Church, but the
Greek word, Ecclesia, therefore Erasmus, in his new
translation gave it a Latin word. But we in our English
had a proper English word for it, and therefore
there was no cause for Tyndale to translate it into a
worse. Erasmus, moreover, meant therein no heresy,
as appears by his writings against heretics, but Tyndale,
intended nothing else thereby, as appears by the heresies
that he himself teaches and abides by. Therefore,
there was in this matter no cause for me to contend
with Erasmus, as there was to contend with Tyndale,
with whom I contended for putting ‘congregation’
instead of ‘Church.’”<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Further, More blames Tyndale’s translation in its
substitution of <i>senior</i> or <i>elder</i> for the old-established
word <i>priest</i>. This word, presbyter, in the Greek, he
says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> “as it signifies the thing that men call priest in
English, was sometimes called <i>senior</i> in Latin. But
the thing that Englishmen call a priest, and the Greek
church called <i>presbyter</i>, and the Latin church also
sometimes called <i>senior</i>, was never called elder either
in the Greek church, or the Latin or the English.”<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> He
considers, therefore, the change made by Tyndale, in
the second edition of his translation, from senior into
elder was not only no improvement, but a distinct
and reiterated rejection of the well-understood word
of priest.… “I said and say,” he continues, “that
Tyndale changed the word priest into senior with the
heretical mind and intent to set forth his heresy, in
which he teaches that the priesthood is no sacrament
… for else I would not call it heresy if any one
would translate <i>presbyteros</i> a block, but I would say
he was a blockhead. And as great a blockhead were
he that would translate <i>presbyteros</i> into an elder instead
of a priest, for this English word no more signifies
an elder than the Greek word <i>presbyteros</i> signifies an
elderstick.”<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> “For the same reason he might change
bishop into overseer, and deacon into server, both of
which he might as well do, as priest into elder; and
then with his English translation he must make us an
English vocabulary of his own device, and so with such
provision he may change chin into cheek, and belly
into back, and every word into every other at his own
pleasure, if all England like to go to school with Tyndale
to learn English&mdash;but else, not so.”<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>In the same way More condemns Tyndale for
deliberately changing the word “Grace,” the meaning
of which was fully understood by Catholic Englishmen,
into “favour,” “thinking that his own scoffing is sufficient
reason to change the known holy name of virtue
through all Scripture into such words as he himself
liketh.”<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> He says the same of the change of the old
familiar words <i>Confession</i> into <i>knowledge</i>, and <i>penance</i> into
<i>repentance</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> “This is what Tyndale means: he would
have all willing confession quite cast away and all
penance doing too.”<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> And “as for the word <i>penance</i>,
whatsoever the Greek word be, it ever was, and still is,
lawful enough (if Tyndale give us leave) to call anything
in English by whatever word Englishmen by
common custom agree upon.… Now, the matter
does not rest in this at all. For Tyndale is not angry
with the word, but with the matter. For this grieves
Luther and him that by <i>penance</i> we understand, when
we speak of it … not mere repenting … but also
every part of the Sacrament of Penance; oral confession,
contrition of heart, and satisfaction by good deeds.
For if we called it the Sacrament of repentance, and by
that word would understand what we now do by the
word penance, Tyndale would then be as angry with
repentance as he is now with penance.”<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Speaking specially in another place about the
change of the old word <i>charity</i> into <i>love</i> in Tyndale’s
translation, More declared that he would not much
mind which word was used were it not for the evident
intention to change the teaching. When it is done
consistently through the whole book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> “no man could
deem but that the man meant mischievously. If he
called <i>charity</i> sometimes by the bare name <i>love</i>, I would
not stick at that. But since charity signifies in Englishmen’s
ears not every common love, but a good virtuous
and well-ordered love, he that will studiously flee from
the name of good love, and always speak of ‘love,’ and
always leave out ‘good,’ I would surely say he meant
evil. And it is much more than likely. For it is to
be remembered that at the time of this translation
Huchins (or Tyndale) was with Luther in Wittenberg,
and put certain glosses in the margins, made to uphold
the ungracious sect.”… And “the reason why he
changed the name of <i>charity</i> and of the <i>church</i> and of
<i>priesthood</i> is no very great difficulty to perceive. For
since Luther and his fellows amongst their other
damnable heresies have one that all salvation rests on
Faith alone&mdash;therefore he purposely works to diminish
the reverent mind that men have to charity, and for
this reason changes the name of holy virtuous affection
into the bare name of love.”</p>

<p>In concluding his justification of the condemnation
of Tyndale’s Testament and his criticism of the translator’s
<i>Defence</i>, Sir Thomas More says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> “Every man
knows well that the intent and purpose of my <i>Dyalogue</i>
was to make men see that Tyndale in his translation
changed the common known words in order to make
a change in the faith. As for example: he changed
the word <i>Church</i> into this word <i>congregation</i>, because he
would raise the question which the church was, and
set forth Luther’s heresy that the church which we
should believe and obey is not the common known
body of all Christian realms remaining in the faith of
Christ and not fallen away or cut off with heresies.…
But the church we should believe and obey was
some secret unknown kind of evil living and worse
believing heretics. And he changed <i>priest</i> into <i>senior</i>,
because he intended to set forth Luther’s heresy teaching
that priesthood is no sacrament, but the office of a
layman or laywoman appointed by the people to preach.
And he changed <i>Penance</i> into <i>repenting</i>, because he would
set forth Luther’s heresy teaching that penance is no
sacrament. This being the only purpose of my <i>Dyalogue</i>,
Tyndale now comes and expressly confesses what I
proposed to show. For he indeed teaches and writes
openly these false heresies so that he himself shows
now that I then told the people the truth … his own
writing shows that he made his translation to the intent
to set forth such heresies as I said he did.”<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>John Standish in the tract on the vernacular
Scriptures, published in Queen Mary’s reign, uses in
some places the same language as Sir Thomas More
in condemning the translations which had been later
in vogue. “At all times,” he writes, “heretics have
laboured to corrupt the Scriptures that they might
serve for their naughty purposes and to confirm their
errors therewith, but especially now in our time. O
good Lord, how have the translators of the Bible into
English purposely corrupted the texts, oft maliciously
putting in such words as in the readers’ ears might
serve for the proof of such heresies as they went about
to sow. These are not only set forth in the translations,
but also in certain prologues and glosses added
thereunto, and these things they have so handled (as
indeed it is no great mastery to do) with probable
reasons very apparent to the simple and unlearned,
that an infinite number of innocents they have spiritually
poisoned and corrupted within this realm, and
caused them to perish obstinately.”<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>If further proof were wanting that the New Testament
as set forth by Tyndale was purposely designed
to overthrow the then existing religious principles held
by English churchmen, it is furnished by works subsequently
published by the English Lutherans abroad.
The tract named <i>The Burying of the Mass</i>, printed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Germany shortly after the burning of Tyndale’s Testament,
was, as Sir Thomas More points out, intended
as a direct attack upon the Sacrifice of the Mass and
the Sacramental system. In it the author poured out
the vials of his wrath upon all those who caused
Tyndale’s translation of the New Testament to be
destroyed, saying that they burned it because it
destroyed the Mass. “By this,” adds More, “you
may see that the author accounted the translation
very good for the destruction of the Mass.”<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Moreover,
in a book called <i>The Wicked Mammon</i>, published
by Tyndale himself shortly after this, although he
blames the style of the author of <i>The Burying of the
Mass</i>, he tacitly accepts his assertion that his translation
of the New Testament was intended to bring about
the abolition of the Sacrifice of the Mass.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>In later times, after the experience of the religious
changes in the reign of Edward VI., some writers
pointed to the evils, religious and social, as evidence
of the harm done by the promiscuous reading of the
Scriptures. In their opinion, what More had feared
and foretold had come to pass. “In these miserable
years now past,” says Standish of Mary’s reign, in this
tract on the vernacular Scriptures:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> “In these miserable
years now past, what mystery is so hard that the
ignorant with the Bible in English durst not set upon,
yea and say they understood it: all was light! They
desired no explanation but their own, even in the
highest mysteries.… Alas! experience shows that
our own men through having the Bible in English
have walked far above their reach, being sundry ways
killed and utterly poisoned with the letter of the
English Bible.”<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>The spirit in which the study of Sacred Scripture
was taken up by many in those days is described by
the Marian preacher, Roger Edgworth, already referred
to. “Scripture,” he says, “is in worse case
than any other faculty: for where other faculties take
upon them no more than pertaineth to their own
science, as (for example) the physician of what pertains
to the health of man’s body, and the carpenter
and smith of their own tools and workmanship&mdash;the
faculty of Sacred Scripture alone is the knowledge
which all men and women challenge and claim to
themselves and for their own. Here and there the
chattering old wife, the doting old man, the babbling
sophister, and all others presume upon this faculty,
and tear it and teach it before they learn it. Of all
such green divines as I have spoken of, it appeareth
full well what learning they have by this, that when
they teach any of their disciples, and when they give
any of their books to other men to read, the first
suggestion why he should labour (at) such books is
‘because of this,’ say they, ‘thou shalt be able to
oppose the best priest in the parish, and tell him he
lies.’”<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The result is patent in the history of the religious
confusions which followed, for this much must be
allowed, whatever view may be taken of the good
or evil which ultimately resulted. Dr. Richard Smith,
in 1546, then states the position as he saw it:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> “In
old times the faith was respected, but in our days
not a few things, and not of small importance, but
(alack the more the pity) even the chiefest and most
weighty matters of religion and faith, are called in
question, babbled about, talked and jangled upon
(reasoned, I cannot and ought not to call it).”<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>Although the cry for the open Bible which had
been raised by Tyndale and the other early English
reformers generally assumed the right to free and
personal interpretation of its meaning, no sooner was
the English Scripture put into circulation than its
advocates proclaimed the need of expositions to teach
people the meaning they should attach to it. In fact,
the marginal notes and glosses, furnished by Tyndale
chiefly from Lutheran sources, are evidence that even
he had no wish that the people should understand or
interpret the sacred text otherwise than according to
his peculiar views. Very quickly after the permission
of Henry VIII. had allowed the circulation of the
printed English Bible, commentators came forward
to explain their views. Lancelot Ridley, for example,
issued many such explanations of portions of the
Sacred Text with the object, as he explains, of enabling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
“the unlearned to declare the Holy Scriptures now
suffered to all people of this realm to read and study
at their pleasure.” For the Bible, “which is now
undeclared (<i>i.e.</i> unexplained) to them, and only had in
the bare letter, appears to many rather death than
life, rather (calculated) to bring many to errors and
heresies than into the truth and verity of God’s Word.
For this, when unexplained, does not bring the simple,
rude, and ignorant people from their ignorant blindness,
from their corrupt and backward judgments, false
trusts, evil beliefs, vain superstitions, and feigned holiness,
in which the people have long been in blindness, for
lack of a knowledge of Holy Scripture which the man
of Rome kept under latch and would not suffer to
come to light, that his usurped power should not have
been espied, his worldly glory diminished, and his
profit decayed.”<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>Again, in another exposition made eight years later,
the same writer complains that still, for lack of teaching
what he considers the true meaning of Scripture, the
views of the people are still turned towards the “old
superstitions” in spite of “the open Bible.” “Although
the Bible be in English,” he says, “and be suffered to
every man and woman to read at their pleasures, and
commanded to be read every day at Matins, Mass, and
Evensong, yet there remain great ignorance and corrupt
judgments … and these will remain still, except the
Holy Scriptures be made more plain to the lay people
who are unlearned by some commentary or annotation,
so that lay people may understand the Holy Scripture
better.”<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Commentaries would help much, he says in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
another place, “to deliver the people from ignorance,
darkness, errors, heresy, superstitions, false trusts, and
from evil opinions fixed and rooted in the hearts of
many for lack of true knowledge of God’s Holy Word,
and expel the usurped power of the bishop of Rome
and all Romish dregs.”<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to find that from the first, whilst
objecting to the interpretation of the old teachers of
the Church, and claiming that the plain text of Scripture
was a sufficient antidote and complete answer
to them and their traditional deductions, the “new
teachers” found that without teaching and exposition
on their part, the open Bible was by no means sufficient
to wean the popular mind from what they regarded as
superstitious and erroneous ways. Their attitude in
the matter is at least a confirmation of the contention
of Sir Thomas More and other contemporary Catholic
writers, that the vernacular Scriptures would be useless
without a teaching authority to interpret their meaning.</p>

<p>A brief word may now be said as a summary of
the attitude towards the vernacular Bible taken up by
the ecclesiastical authorities on the eve of the Reformation.
The passages quoted from Sir Thomas More
make it evident that no such hostility on the part of
the Church, as writers of all shades of opinion have too
hastily assumed, really existed.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> In fact, though those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
responsible for the conduct of affairs, both ecclesiastical
and lay, at this period objected to the circulation
of Tyndale’s printed New Testament, this objection
was based, not on any dread of allowing the English
Bible as such, but on the natural objection to an
obviously incorrect translation. It is difficult to see
how those in authority could have permitted a version
with traditional words changed for the hardly concealed
purpose of supporting Lutheran tenets, with texts
garbled and marginal explanations inserted for the
same end. Those who hold that Tyndale’s views were
right, and even that his attempt to enforce them in
this way was justifiable, can hardly, however, blame
the authorities at that time in England, secular or lay,
who did not think so, from doing all they could to
prevent what they regarded as the circulation of a
book calculated to do great harm if no means were
taken to prevent it. Men’s actions must be judged
by the circumstances under which they acted, and it
would be altogether unjust to regard the prohibition
of the Tyndale Scriptures as a final attempt on the part
of the English Church to prevent the circulation of the
vernacular Scriptures. To the authorities in those days
at least, the book in question did not represent the
Sacred Text at all. That it was full of errors, to say
the least, is confessed by Tyndale himself; and as to
the chief points in his translation which he defended
and which Sir Thomas More so roundly condemned,
posterity has sided with More and not with Tyndale,
for not one of these special characteristics of the translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
in which so much of Tyndale’s Lutheran teaching
was allowed to appear, was suffered to remain in
subsequent revisions. From this point of view alone,
those who examine the question with an unbiassed
mind must admit that there was ample justification for
the prohibition of Tyndale’s printed Testament. If this
be so, the further point may equally well be conceded,
namely, that the Church on the eve of the Reformation
did not prohibit the vernacular Scriptures as such at
all, and that many churchmen in common with the
king, Sir Thomas More, and other laymen, would,
under happier circumstances, have been glad to see a
properly translated English Bible.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">TEACHING AND PREACHING</span></h2>

<p>It is very commonly assumed that on the eve of the
Reformation, and for a long period before, there was
little in the way of popular religious instruction in
England. We are asked to believe that the mass of
the people were allowed to grow up in ignorance of
the meaning of the faith that was in them, and in a
studied neglect of their supposed religious practices.
So certain has this view of the pre-Reformation Church
seemed to those who have not inquired very deeply
into the subject, that more than one writer has been
led by this assumption to assert that perhaps the most
obvious benefit of the religious upheaval of the sixteenth
century was the introduction of some general and
systematic teaching of the great truths of religion.
Preaching is often considered as characterising the
reforming movement, as contrasted with the old ecclesiastical
system, which it is assumed certainly admitted,
even if it did not positively encourage, ignorance as the
surest foundation of its authority. It becomes of importance,
therefore, to inquire if such a charge is
founded upon fact, and to see how far, if at all, the
people in Catholic England were instructed in their
religion.</p>

<p>At the outset, it should be remembered that the
questions at issue in the sixteenth century were not, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the first place at least, connected with the influence of
religious teaching on the lives of the people at large.
No one contended that the reformed doctrines would
be found to make people better, or would help them
to lead lives more in conformity with Gospel teaching.
The question of what may be called practical religion
never entered into the disputes of the time. Mr. Brewer
warns the student of the history of this period that he
will miss the meaning of many things altogether, and
quite misunderstand their drift, if he starts his inquiry
by regarding the Reformation as the creation of light
to illuminate a previous period of darkness, or the
evolution of practical morality out of a state of antecedent
chaotic corruption. “In fact,” he says, “the
sixteenth century was not a mass of moral corruption
out of which life emerged by some process unknown to
art or nature; it was not an addled egg cradling a
living bird; quite the reverse.” For, as the historian of
the German people, Janssen, points out, the truth is that
the entire social order of the Middle Ages “was established
on the doctrine of good works being necessary
for the salvation of the Christian soul.” Whilst, as
Mr. Brewer again notes, Luther’s most earnest remonstrances
were directed not against <i>bad</i> works, but against
the undue stress laid by the advocates of the old religion
upon <i>good</i> works. Moreover, an age which could busy
itself about discussions of questions as to “righteousness,”
whether of “faith or works,” “is not a demoralised
or degenerate age. These are not the
thoughts of men buried in sensuality.”</p>

<p>Two questions are contained in the inquiry as to
pre-Reformation religious teaching, namely, as to its
extent and as to its character. There can hardly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
much doubt that the duty of giving instruction to the
people committed to their charge was fully recognised
by the clergy in mediæval times. In view of the positive
legislation of various synods on the subject of
regular and systematic teaching, as well as of the
constant repetition of the obligation in the books of
English canon law, it is obvious that the priests were
not ignorant of what was their plain duty. From the
time of the constitution of Archbishop Peckham at the
Synod of Oxford in 1281, to the time of the religious
changes, there is every reason to suppose that the
ordinance contained in the following words was observed
in every parish church in the country: “We
order,” says the Constitution, “that every priest having
the charge of a flock do, four times in each year (that
is, once each quarter) on one or more solemn feast
days, either himself or by some one else, instruct the
people in the vulgar language simply and without any
fantastical admixture of subtle distinctions, in the
articles of the Creed, the Ten Commandments, the
Evangelical Precepts, the seven works of mercy, the
seven deadly sins with their offshoots, the seven principal
virtues, and the seven Sacraments.”</p>

<p>This means that the whole range of Christian
teaching, dogmatic and moral, was to be explained to
the people four times in every year; and in order that
there should be no doubt about the matter, the Synod
proceeds to set out in considerable detail each of the
points upon which the priest was to instruct his people.
During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the great
number of manuals intended to help the clergy in the
execution of this law attest the fact that it was fully
recognised and very generally complied with. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
at the close of the latter century, the invention of
printing made the multiplication of such manuals easy,
the existence both of printed copies of this Constitution
of Archbishop Peckham, and of printed tracts drawn
up to give every assistance to the parochial clergy in
the preparation of these homely teachings, proves that
the law was understood and acted upon. In the face
of such evidence it is impossible to doubt that, whatever
may have been the case as to set sermons and
formal discourses, simple, straightforward teaching was
not neglected in pre-Reformation England, and every
care was taken that the clergy might be furnished with
material suitable for the fundamental religious teaching
contemplated by the law. As late as 1466, a synod of
the York Province, held by Archbishop Nevill, not
only reiterated this general decree about regular quarterly
instructions of a simple and practical kind, but
set out at great length the points of these lessons in
the Christian faith and life upon which the parish
priests were to insist.</p>

<p>Even set discourses of a more formal kind, though
probably by no means so frequent as in these times,
when they have to a great extent superseded the simple
instructions of old Catholic days, were by no means
neglected. Volumes of such sermons in manuscript
and in print, as well as all that is known of the great
discourses constantly being delivered at St. Paul’s
Cross, may be taken as sufficient evidence of this.
For the conveyance of moral and religious instruction,
however, the regular and homely talks of a parish
priest to his people were vastly more important than
the set orations, and it is with these familiar instructions
that the student of this period of our history has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
chiefly to concern himself. All the available evidence
goes to show that the giving of these was not only
regarded as an obligation on the pastor; but attendance
at them was looked upon as a usual and necessary
portion of the Christian duty. For example, in the
examinations of conscience intended to assist lay
people in their preparation for the Sacrament of penance,
there are indications that any neglect to attend
at these parochial instructions was considered sufficiently
serious to become a matter of confession. It
is, of course, hardly conceivable that this should be
so, if the giving of these popular lessons in the duties
of the Christian life was neglected by the priests, or
if they were not commonly frequented by the laity.
To take a few instances. “Also,” runs one such examination,
“I have been slow in God’s service, and
negligent to pray and to go to church in due time …
loth to hear the Word of God, and the preacher of
the Word of God. Neither have I imprinted it in my
heart and borne it away and wrought thereafter.”<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
Again: “I have been setting nought by preaching
and teaching of God’s Word, by thinking it an idle
thing.”<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> And, to take an example of the view taken
in such documents as to the priest’s duty:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> “If you are
a priest be a true lantern to the people both in speaking
and in living, and faithfully and truly do all things
which pertain to a priest. Seek wisely the ground of
truth and the true office of the priesthood, and be
not ruled blindly by the lewd customs of the world.
Read God’s law and the Expositions of the Holy
Doctors, and study and learn and keep it, and when
thou knowest it, preach and teach it to those that are
unlearned.”<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Richard Whitford, the Monk of Sion, in his <i>Work
for Householders</i>, published first in 1530, lays great
stress upon the obligation of parents and masters to
see that those under their charge attended the instructions
given in the parish church. Some may perhaps
regard his greater anxiety for their presence at sermons
rather than at Mass, when it was not possible for them
to be at both, as doubtful advice. In this, however, he
agrees with the author of what was the most popular
book of instructions at this period, and the advice itself
is proof that the obligation of attending instructions was
regarded as sufficiently serious to be contrasted with
that of hearing Mass. Speaking of the Sunday duties,
Whitford says: “At church on Sundays see after those
who are under your care. And charge them also
to keep their sight in the church close upon their book
and beads. And whilst they are young accustom them
always to kneel, stand, and sit, and never walk in the
church. And let them hear the Mass quietly and
devoutly, much part kneeling. But at the Gospel, the
Preface, and at the Paternoster teach them to stand
and to make curtesy at the word Jesus, as the priest
does.… If there be a sermon any time of the day
let them be present, all that are not occupied in needful
and lawful business; all other (occupations) laid
aside let them ever keep the preachings, rather than
the Mass, if, perchance, they may not hear both.”</p>

<p>Nothing could possibly be more definite or explicit
upon the necessity of popular instructions and upon
the duty incumbent upon the clergy of giving proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
vernacular teaching to their flocks than the author of
<i>Dives et Pauper</i>, the most popular of the fifteenth-century
books of religious instruction. In fact, on this
point his language is as strong and uncompromising as
that which writers have too long been accustomed to
associate with the name of Wycliffe. No more unwarranted
assumption has ever been made in the name
of history than that which classed under the head of
Lollard productions almost every fifteenth-century tract
in English, especially such as dealt openly with abuses
needing correction, and pleaded for simple vernacular
teaching of religion. This is what the author of <i>Dives
et Pauper</i> says about preaching:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> “Since God’s word is
life and salvation of man’s soul, all those who hinder
them that have authority of God, and by Orders taken,
to preach and teach, from preaching and teaching God’s
word and God’s law, are manslayers ghostly. They are
guilty of as many souls that perish by the hindering of
God’s word, and namely those proud, covetous priests
and curates who can neither teach, nor will teach, nor
suffer others that both can and will and have authority
to teach and preach of God and of the bishop who gave
them Orders, but prevent them for fear lest they should
get less from their subjects, or else the less be thought
of, or else that their sins should be known by the
preaching of God’s word. Therefore, they prefer to
leave their own sins openly reproved generally, among
other men’s sins. As St. Anselm saith, God’s word
ought to be worshipped as much as Christ’s body, and
he sins as much who hindereth God’s word and despiseth
God’s word, or taketh it recklessly as he that despiseth
God’s body, or through his negligence letteth it
fall to the ground. On this place the gloss showeth
that it is more profitable to hear God’s word in preaching
than to hear a Mass, and that a man should rather
forbear his Mass than his sermon. For, by preaching,
folks are stirred to contrition, and to forsake sin and
the fiend, and to love God and goodness, and (by it)
they be illumined to know their God, and virtue from
vice, truth from falsehood, and to forsake errors and
heresies. By the Mass they are not so, but if they
come to Mass in sin they go away in sin, and shrews
they come and shrews they wend away.… Nevertheless,
the Mass profiteth them that are in grace to get
grace and forgiveness of sin.… Both are good, but
the preaching of God’s word ought to be more discharged
and more desired than the hearing of Mass.”<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>In the same way the author of a little book named
<i>The Interpretatyon and Sygnyfycacyon of the Masse</i>, printed
by Robert Wyer in 1532, insists on the obligation of
attending the Sunday instruction. “On each Sunday,”
he says, “he shall also hear a sermon, if it be possible,
for if a man did lose or omit it through
contempt or custom, he would sin greatly.”<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> And in
<i>The Myrrour of the Church</i>, the author tells those who
desire “to see the Will of God in Holy Scripture,” but
being of “simple learning” and “no cunning” cannot
read, that they may do so “in open sermon, or in
secret collation” with those who can. And in speaking
of the Sunday duties he tells his readers not to
lie in bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> “but rising promptly you shall go to the
church, and with devotion say your matins without
jangling. Also sweetly hear your Mass and all the
hours of the day. And then if there is any preacher
in the church who proposes to make a sermon, you
shall sweetly hear the Word of God and keep it in
remembrance.”<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> And lastly, to take one more example,
in Wynkyn de Worde’s <i>Exornatorium Curatorum</i>,
printed to enable those having the cure of souls to
perform the duties of instruction laid down by Archbishop
Peckham’s Provincial Constitution, whilst setting
forth a form of examination of conscience under the
head of the deadly sins, the author bids the curate
teach his people to ask themselves: “Whether you
have been slothful in God’s service, and specially upon
the Sunday and the holy day whether you have been
slothful to come to church, slothful to pray when you
have been there, and slothful to hear the Word of
God preached. Furthermore, whether you have been
negligent to learn your <i>Pater Noster</i>, your <i>Ave Maria</i>,
or your Creed, or whether you have been negligent
to teach the same to your own children or to your
god-children. Examine yourself also whether you have
taught your children good manners, and guarded them
from danger and bad company.” The same book
insists on the need of such examination of conscience
daily, or at least weekly.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>The following in this connection is of interest as
being a daily rule of life recommended to laymen
in the English Prymer printed at Rouen in 1538:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
“First rise up at six o’clock in the morning
at all seasons, and in rising do as follows: Thank
our Lord who has brought you to the beginning of
the day. Commend yourself to God, to Our Lady
Saint Mary, and to the saint whose feast is kept that
day, and to all the saints in heaven. When you have
arrayed yourself say in your chamber or lodging,
Matins, Prime, and Hours, if you may. Then go to
the church before you do any worldly works if you
have no needful business, and abide in the church the
space of a low mass time, where you shall think on God
and thank Him for His benefits. Think awhile on the
goodness of God, on His divine might and virtue.…
If you cannot be so long in the church on account of
necessary business, take some time in the day in your
house in which to think of these things.”… Take
your meal “reasonably without excess or overmuch
forbearing of your meat, for there is as much danger
in too little as in too much. If you fast once in a
week it is enough, besides Vigils and Ember days out
of Lent.” After dinner rest “an hour or half-an-hour,
praying God that in that rest He will accept your health
to the end, that after it you may serve Him the more
devoutly.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>“… As touching your service, say up to <i>Tierce</i>
before dinner, and make an end of all before supper.
And when you are able say the <i>Dirge</i> and <i>Commendations</i>
for all Christian souls, at least on holy days, and
if you have leisure say them on other days, at least
with three lessons. Shrive yourself every week to your
curate, except you have some great hindrance. And
beware that you do not pass a fortnight unless you
have a very great hindrance. If you have the means
refuse not your alms to the first poor body that asketh
it of you that day. Take care to hear and keep the
Word of God. Confess you every day to God without
fail of such sins you know you have done that day.”
Think often of our Lord’s Passion, and at night when
you wake turn your thoughts to what our Lord was
doing at that hour in His Passion. In your life look
for a faithful friend to whom you may open “your
secrets,” and when found follow his advice. No doubt
this “manner to live well” will perhaps hardly represent
what people at this time ordinarily did. But
the mere fact that it could be printed as a Christian’s
daily rule of life as late as 1538, is evidence at
any rate that people took at the least as serious a
view of their obligations in religious matters as we
should.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> In the same way <i>The art of good lyvyng</i>,
quoted above, suggests as the proper way to sanctify
the Sunday: Meditations on death, the pains of hell,
and the joys of Paradise. Time should be given to
reading the lives of the saints, to saying Matins, and
studying the Paternoster and the Creed. Others
should be exhorted to enter into God’s service, and
fathers of families are bound to see that “their
children, servants, and families go to church and hear
the preachings.”<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>By far the most interesting and important part of
any inquiry on the subject of pre-Reformation instructions,
regards of course their nature and effect. We are
asked to believe that the people were allowed to grow
up in ignorance of the true nature of religion, and with
superstitions in their hearts which the clergy could
easily have corrected; but which they, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
rather fostered as likely to prove of pecuniary value to
themselves. To keep the people ignorant (it is said) was
their great object, as it was through the ignorance of the
lay folk that the clergy hoped to maintain their influence
and ascendency, and, it is suggested, to draw money
out of the pockets of the faithful. The reverence
which was paid at this time to images of the saints,
and in an especial manner to the crucifix, is often
adduced as proof that the people were evidently badly
instructed in the nature of religious worship; and the
destruction of statues, paintings, and pictured glass by
the advanced reformers is thought to be explained, if
not excused, by the absolute need of putting a stop
once for all to a crying abuse. The explanation given
to the people by their religious teachers on the eve
of the religious changes on this matter of devotion to
the saints, and of the nature of the reverence to be
paid to their representations, may be taken as a good
sample of the practical nature of the general instructions
imparted in those times. The question divested
of all ambiguity is really this: Were the people taught
to understand the nature of an image or representation,
or were they allowed to regard them as objects of
reverence in themselves&mdash;that is, as <i>idols</i>? The material
for a reply to this inquiry is fortunately abundant.
The <i>Dyalogue</i> of Sir Thomas More was written in 1528,
in order to maintain the Catholic teaching about images,
relics, and the praying to saints. To this, then, an inquirer
naturally turns in the first place for an exposition
of the common belief in these matters; for Sir Thomas
claims that in his tract he is defending only “the
common faith and belief of Christ’s Church.” “What
this is,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> “I am very sure; and perceive it
well not only by experience of my own time and the
places where I have myself been to, with the common
report of other honest men from all other places of
Christendom.” After having explained that the commandment
of God had reference to idols or images
worshipped as gods, and not to mere representations
of Christ, our Lady, or the Saints,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> he continues:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> “but
neither Scripture nor natural reason forbids a man to
reverence an image, not fixing his final intent on the
image, but referring the honour to the person the
image represents. In such reverence shown to an
image there is no honour withdrawn from God; but
the saint is honoured in his image, and God in His
saint. When a man of mean birth and an ambassador
to a great king has high honour done to him, to whom
does that honour redound, to the ambassador or to the
king? When a man on the recital of his prince’s letter
puts off his cap and kisses it, does he reverence the
paper or his prince?… All names spoken and all
words written are no material signs or images, but are
made only by consent and agreement of men to betoken
and signify such things, whereas images painted,
graven, or carved, may be so well wrought and so
near to the life and the truth, that they will naturally
and much more effectually represent the thing than the
name either spoken or written.… These two words,
<i>Christus crucifixus</i>, do not represent to us, either to laymen
or to the learned, so lively a remembrance of His
bitter Passion as does a blessed image of the crucifix,
and this these heretics perceive well enough. Nor do
they speak against images in order to further devotion,
but plainly with a malicious mind to diminish and
quench men’s devotions. For they see clearly that no
one who loves another does not delight in his image
or in anything of his. And these heretics who are
so sore against the images of God and His holy saints,
would be right angry with him that would dishonestly
handle an image made in remembrance of one of
themselves, whilst the wretches forbear not to handle
villainously, and in despite cast dirt upon the holy
crucifix, an image made in remembrance of our
Saviour Himself, and not only of His most blessed
Person, but also of His most bitter Passion.”<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Later on, in the same tract, rejecting the notion
that people did not fully understand that the image
was intended merely to recall the memory of the person
whose image it was, and was not itself in any sense the
thing or person, More says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> “The flock of Christ is
not so foolish as those heretics would make them to
be. For whereas there is no dog so mad that he does
not know a real coney (<i>i.e.</i> rabbit) from a coney carved
and painted, (yet they would have it supposed that)
Christian people that have reason in their heads, and
therefore the light of faith in their souls, would think
that the image of our Lady were our Lady herself.
Nay, they be not so mad, I trust, but that they do
reverence to the image for the honour of the person
whom it represents, as every man delights in the image
and remembrance of his friend. And although every
good Christian man has a remembrance of Christ’s
passion in his mind, and conceives by devout meditation
a form and fashion thereof in his heart, yet there
is no man I ween so good nor so learned, nor so well
accustomed to meditation, but that he finds himself
more moved to pity and compassion by beholding the
holy crucifix than when he lacks it.”<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>In his work against Tyndale, More again takes up
this subject in reference to the way in which the
former in his new translation of the Bible had substituted
the word <i>idol</i> for <i>image</i>, as if they were practically
identical in meaning. “Good folk who worship images
of Christ and His saints, thereby worship Christ and
His saints, whom these images represent.” Just as
pagan worshippers of idols did evil in worshipping
them, “because in them they worshipped devils (whom
they called gods and whom those idols represented), so
Christian men do well in worshipping images, because
in them they worship Christ and His holy saints.”<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Roger Edgworth, the preacher, describes at Bristol
in Queen Mary’s reign how the Reforming party endeavoured
to confuse the minds of the common people
as to the meaning of the word idol. “I would,” he
says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> “that you should not ignorantly confound and
abuse those terms ‘idol’ and ‘image,’ taking an image
for an idol and an idol for an image, as I have heard
many do in this city, as well fathers and mothers (who
should be wise) as their babies and children who have
learned foolishness from their parents. Now, at the
dissolution of the monasteries and friars’ houses many
images have been carried abroad and given to children
to play with, and when the children have them in
their hands, dancing them in their childish manner, the
father or mother comes and says, ‘What nase, what
have you there?’ The child answers (as she is taught),
‘I have here my idol.’ Then the father laughs and
makes a gay game at it. So says the mother to
another, ‘Jugge or Tommy, where did you get that
pretty idol?’ ‘John, our parish clerk gave it to me,’
says the child, and for that the clerk must have thanks
and shall not lack good cheer. But if the folly were
only in the insolent youth, and in the fond unlearned
fathers and mothers, it might soon be redressed.” The
fact is, he proceeds to explain, that the new preachers
have been doing all in their power to obscure the
hitherto well-recognised difference in meaning between
an image and an idol. He begs his hearers to try and
keep the difference in meaning between an image and
an idol clearly before their minds. “An image is a
similitude of a natural thing that has been, is, or may
be,” he tells them. “An idol is a similitude of what
never was or may be. Therefore the image of the
crucifix is no idol, for it represents and signifies Christ
crucified as He was in very deed, and the image of St.
Paul with a sword in his hand as the sign of his martyrdom
is no idol, for the thing signified by it was a
thing indeed, for he was beheaded with a sword.”<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>In another part of the <i>Dialogue</i> Sir Thomas More
pointed out that what the reforming party said against
devotion to images and pilgrimages could be summed
up under one of three heads. They charge the people
with giving “to the saints, and also to their images,
honour like in kind to what they give to God Himself”;
or (2) that “they take the images for the things
themselves,” which is plain idolatry; or (3) that the
worship is conducted in a “superstitious fashion with
a desire of unlawful things.” Now, as to these three
accusations, More replies:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> “The first point is at once
soon and shortly answered, for it is not true. For
though men kneel to saints and images, and incense
them also, yet it is not true that they for this reason
worship them in every point like unto God.… They
lack the chief point (of such supreme worship). That
is, they worship God in the mind that He is God, which
intention in worship is the only thing that maketh it
<i>latria</i>, and not any certain gesture or bodily observance.”
It would not be supreme or divine worship even if “we
would wallow upon the ground unto Christ, having in
this a mind that He were the best man we could think
of, but not thinking Him to be God. For if the lowly
manner of bodily observance makes <i>latria</i>, then we
were in grave peril of idolatry in our courtesy used to
princes, prelates, and popes, to whom we kneel as low
as to God Almighty, and kiss some their hands and
some our own, ere ever we presume to touch them;
and in the case of the Pope, his foot; and as for
incensing, the poor priests in every choir are as well
incensed as the Sacrament. Hence if <i>latria</i>, which is
the special honour due to God, was contained in these
things, then we were great idolaters, not only in our
worship of the saints and of their images, but also of
men, one to another among ourselves.” Though indeed
to God Almighty ought to be shown as “humble and
lowly a bodily reverence as possible, still this bodily
worship is not <i>latria</i>, unless we so do it in our mind
considering and acknowledging Him as God, and with
that mind and intention do our worship; and this, as I
think,” he says, “no Christian man does to any image
or to any saint either.”</p>

<p>“Now, as touching the second point&mdash;namely, that
people take the images for the saints themselves, I trust
there is no man so mad, or woman either, that they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
not know live men from dead stones, and a tree from
flesh and bone. And when they prefer our Lady at
one pilgrimage place before our Lady at another, or
one rood before another, or make their invocations and
vows some to the one and some to the other, I ween it
easy to perceive that they mean nothing else than that
our Lord and our Lady, or rather our Lord for our
Lady, shows more miracles at the one than the other.
They intend in their pilgrimages to visit, some one
place and some another, or sometimes the place is
convenient for them, or their devotion leads them;
and yet (this is) not for the place, but because our
Lord pleases by manifest miracles to provoke men to
seek Him, or His Blessed Mother, or some Holy Saint
of His, in these places more especially than in some
others.”</p>

<p>“This thing itself proves also that they do not take
the images of our Lady for herself. For if they did,
how could they possibly in any wise have more mind
to one of them than to the other? For they can have
no more mind to our Lady than to our Lady. Moreover,
if they thought that the image at Walsingham was
our Lady herself then must they needs think that our
Lady herself was that image. Then, if in like manner
they thought that the image at Ipswich was our Lady
herself, and as they must then need think that our
Lady was the image at Ipswich, they must needs think
that all these three things were one thing.… And so
by the same reason they must suppose that the image
at Ipswich was the self-same image as at Walsingham.
If you ask any one you take for the simplest, except
a natural fool, I dare hold you a wager she will tell
you ‘nay’ to this. Besides this, take the simplest fool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
you can find and she will tell you our Lady herself is
in heaven. She will also call an image an image, and
she will tell you the difference between an image of
a horse and a horse in very deed. And this appears
clearly whatever her words about her pilgrimage are
calling, according to the common manner of speech,
the image of our Lady, our Lady. As men say, ‘Go
to the King’s Head for wine,’ not meaning his real
head, but the sign, so she means nothing more in the
image but our Lady’s image, no matter how she may
call it. And if you would prove she neither takes our
Lady for the image, nor the image for our Lady&mdash;talk
with her about our Lady and she will tell you that our
Lady was saluted by Gabriel; that our Lady fled into
Egypt with Joseph; and yet in the telling she will never
say that ‘our Lady of Walsingham,’ or ‘of Ipswich,’
was saluted by Gabriel, or fled into Egypt. If you
would ask her whether it was ‘our Lady of Walsingham,’
or ‘our Lady of Ipswich,’ that stood by the cross
at Christ’s Passion, she will, I warrant you, make
answer that it was neither of them; and if you further
ask her, ‘which Lady then,’ she will name you no
image, but our Lady who is in heaven. And this I
have proved often, and you may do so, too, when you
will and shall find it true, except it be in the case of
one so very a fool that God will give her leave to
believe what she likes. And surely, on this point,
I think in my mind that all those heretics who make
as though they had found so much idolatry among the
people for mistaking (the nature) of images, do but
devise the fear, to have some cloak to cover their
heresy, wherein they bark against the saints themselves,
and when they are marked they say they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
only mean the wrong beliefs that women have in
images.”<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>As regards the third point&mdash;namely, that honour
is sometimes shown to the saints and their images
in “a superstitious fashion with a desire of unlawful
things,” More would be ready to blame this as much
as any man if it could be shown to be the case. “But
I would not,” he says, “blame all things which are
declared to be of this character by the new teachers.
For example, to pray to St. Apollonia for the help
of our teeth is no witchcraft, considering that she had
her teeth pulled out for Christ’s sake. Nor is there any
superstition in other suchlike things.” Still, where
abuses can be shown they ought to be put down as
abuses, and the difference between a lawful use and
an unlawful abuse recognised. But because there may
be abuses done on the Sunday, or in Lent, that is no
reason why the Sunday observance, or the fast of Lent,
should be swept away.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> “In like manner it would not
be right that all due worship of saints and reverence of
relics, and honour of saints’ images, by which good
and devout folk get much merit, should be abolished
and put down because people abuse” these things.
“Now, as touching the evil petitions,” he continues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
“though they who make them were, as I trust they
are not, a great number, they are not yet so many
that ask evil petitions of saints as ask them of God
Himself. For whatsoever such people will ask of a
good saint, they will ask of God Himself, and where
as the worst point it is said, ‘that the people do idolatry
in that they take the images for the saints themselves,
or the rood for Christ Himself,’&mdash;which, as I
have said, I think none do; for some rood has no
crucifix thereon, and they do not believe that the cross
which they see was ever at Jerusalem, or that it was
the holy cross itself, and much less think that the
image that hangs on it is the body of Christ Himself.
And though some were so mad as to think so, yet it
is not ‘the people’ who do so. For a few doddering
dames do not make the people.”<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>It is hard to imagine any teaching about the use
and abuse of images clearer than that which is contained
in the foregoing passages from Sir Thomas
More’s writings. The main importance of his testimony,
however, is not so much this clear statement
of Catholic doctrine on the nature of devotion to
images, as his positive declaration that there were not
such abuses, or superstitions, common among the
people on the eve of the religious changes, as it suited
the purpose of the early reformers to suggest, and of
later writers with sectarian bias to believe.</p>

<p>For evidence of positive and distinct teaching on
the matter of reverence to be shown to images, and
on its nature and limits, we cannot do better than
refer to that most popular book of instruction in the
fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, already referred
to, called <i>Dives et Pauper</i>, a treatise on the Ten Commandments.
It was multiplied from the beginning
of the fifteenth century in manuscript copies, and
printed editions of it were issued from the presses of
Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde, and Thomas Berthelet.
These editions published by our early printers are
sufficient to attest its popularity, and the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
attached to it as a book of instruction by the ecclesiastical
authorities on the eve of the Reformation.</p>

<p>This is how the teacher lays down the general
principle of loving God: “The first precept of charity is
this: Thou shalt love the Lord God with all thy heart,
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, with all thy
might. When He saith thou shalt love thy God with all
thy heart, He excludeth all manner of idolatry that is
forbidden by the first commandment; that is, that man
set not his heart, nor his faith, nor his trust in any
creature more than in God, or against God’s worship.…
God orders that thou shouldst love Him with all
thy heart, that is to say, with all thy faith, in such a
way that thou set all thy faith and trust in Him before
all others, as in Him that is Almighty and can best
help thee in thy need.” Later on, under the same
heading, we are taught that: “by this commandment
we are bound to worship God, who is the Father of all
things, who is called the Father of mercies and God
of all comfort. He is our Father, for He made us of
nought: He bought us with His blood, He findeth us
all that we need, and much more, He feedeth us. He
is our Father by grace, for by His grace He hath
made us heirs of heavenly bliss. Was there ever a
father so tender of his child as God is tender of us?
He is to us both father and mother, and therefore we
are bound to love Him and worship Him above all
things.”<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Under the first commandment the whole question
as to images, and the nature of the reverence to be
paid to them, is carefully considered, and the matter
put so plainly, that there is no room for doubt as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the nature of the instructions given to the people in
pre-Reformation days. Images, the teacher explains,
are ordered for three great ends, namely: “To stir
men’s minds to meditate upon the Incarnation of Christ
and upon His life and passion, and upon the lives of
the saints;” secondly, to move the heart to devotion
and love, “for oft man is stirred more by sight than
by hearing or reading;” thirdly, they “are intended
to be a token and a book to the ignorant people, that
they may read in images and painting as clerks read
in books.”</p>

<p>And in reply to a question from <i>Dives</i>, who pretended
to think that it would be difficult to read a
lesson from any painting, <i>Pauper</i> explains his meaning
in calling them “books to the unlearned.” “When
thou seest the image of the crucifix,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span> “think
of Him that died on the cross for thy sins and thy
sake, and thank Him for His endless charity that He
would suffer so much for thee. See in images how
His head was crowned with a garland of thorns till
the blood burst out on every side, to destroy the great
sin of pride which is most manifested in the heads of
men and women. Behold, and make an end to thy
pride. See in the image how His arms were spread
abroad and drawn up on the tree till the veins and
sinews cracked, and how His hands were nailed to
the cross, and streamed with blood, to destroy the sin
that Adam and Eve did with their hands when they
took the apple against God’s prohibition. Also He
suffered to wash away the sin of the wicked deeds and
wicked works done by the hands of men and women.
Behold, and make an end of thy wicked works. See
how His side was opened and His heart cloven in two
by the sharp spear, and how it shed blood and water,
to show that if He had had more blood in His body,
more He would have given for men’s love. He shed
His blood to ransom our souls, and water to wash
us from our sins.”</p>

<p>But whilst the instructor teaches the way in which
the crucifix may be a book full of deep meaning to
the unlearned, he is most careful to see that the true
signification of the image is not misunderstood. In
language which for clearness of expression and simplicity
of illustration cannot be excelled, he warns <i>Dives</i>
not to mistake the real nature of the reverence paid to the
symbol of our redemption. “In this manner,” he says,
“read thy book and fall down to the ground and thank
thy God who would do so much for thee. Worship
Him above all things&mdash;not the stock, nor the stone, nor
the wood, but Him who died on the tree of the cross
for thy sins and thy sake. Thou shalt kneel if thou
wilt before the image, but not to the image. Thou
shalt do thy worship before the image, before the
thing, not to the thing; offer thy prayer before the
thing, not to the thing, for it seeth thee not, heareth
thee not, understandeth thee not: make thy offering, if
thou wilt, before the thing, but not to the thing: make
thy pilgrimage not to the thing, nor for the thing, for
it may not help thee, but to Him and for Him the
thing represents. For if thou do it for the thing, or to
the thing, thou doest idolatry.”</p>

<p>This plain teaching as to the only meaning of
reverence paid to images, namely, that it is relative
and intended for that which the image represents, our
author enforces by several examples. Just as a priest
when saying mass with a book before him, bends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
down, holds up his hands, kneels, and performs other
external signs of worship, not to the book, but to God,
“so should the unlettered man use his book, that is
images and paintings, not worshipping the thing, but
God in heaven and the saints in their degree. All the
worship which he doth before the thing, he doth, not
to the thing, but to Him the thing represents.”</p>

<p>The image of the crucified Saviour on the altar is
specially intended, our author says, to remind all that
“Mass singing is a special mind-making of Christ’s
passion.” For this reason, in the presence of the
crucifix, the priest says “his mass, and offers up the
highest prayer that Holy Church can devise for the
salvation of the quick and the dead. He holds up his
hands, he bows down, he kneels, and all the worship
he can do, he does&mdash;more than all, he offers up the
highest sacrifice and the best offering that any heart
can devise&mdash;that is Christ, the Son of the God of
heaven, under the form of bread and wine. All this
worship the priest doth at mass before the thing&mdash;the
crucifix; and I hope there is no man nor woman so
ignorant that he will say that the priest singeth his
mass, or maketh his prayer, or offers up the Son of
God, Christ Himself, to the thing.… In the same
way, unlettered men should worship before the thing,
making prayer before the thing, and not to the thing.”</p>

<p>One of the special practices of the mediæval church
to which the English reformers objected, and to which
they gave the epithet “superstitious,” was the honour
shown to the cross on Good Friday, generally known
as “the creeping to the cross.” The advocates of
change in insisting upon this time-honoured ceremony
being swept away, claimed that in permitting it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Church had given occasion to wrong ideas of worship
in the minds of the common people, and that the
reverence shown to the symbol of our redemption on
that occasion amounted practically to idolatry. In
view of such assertions, it is not without interest to
see how <i>Pauper</i> in this book of simple instructions
treats this matter. “On Good Friday especially,” says
<i>Dives</i>, “men creep to the cross and worship the cross.”
“That is so,” replies the instructor, “but not in the
way thou meanest. The cross that we creep to and
worship so highly at that time is Christ Himself, who
died on the cross on that day for our sin and our
sake.… He is that cross, as all doctors say, to
whom we pray and say, ‘<i>Ave crux, spes unica</i>,’ ‘Hail,
thou cross, our only hope.’” But rejoins <i>Dives</i>,
“On Palm Sunday, at the procession the priest draweth
up the veil before the rood and falleth down to the
ground with all the people, saying thrice thus, ‘<i>Ave
Rex noster</i>,’ ‘Hail, be Thou our King.’ In this he worships
the thing as King! <i>Absit!</i>” “God forbid!”
replies <i>Pauper</i>, “he speaks not to the image that the
carpenter hath made and the painter painted, unless
the priest be a fool, for the stock and stone was never
king. He speaketh to Him that died on the cross
for us all&mdash;to Him that is King of all things.… For
this reason are crosses placed by the wayside, to remind
folk to think of Him who died on the cross, and to
worship Him above all things. And for this same
reason is the cross borne before a procession, that
all who follow after it or meet it should worship Him
who died upon a cross as their King, their Head, their
Lord and their Leader to Heaven.”</p>

<p>Equally clear is the author of <i>Dives et Pauper</i> upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the distinction between the worship to be paid to God
and the honour it is lawful to give to His saints. It
is, of course, frequently asserted that the English pre-Reformation
church did not recognise, or at least did
not inculcate, this necessary difference, and consequently
tolerated, even if it did not suggest, gross
errors in this matter. No one who has examined
the manuals of instruction which were in use on the
eve of the Reformation can possibly maintain an
opinion so opposed to the only evidence available.
In particular, the real distinction between the supreme
worship due to God alone, and the honour, however
great, to be paid to His creatures is drawn out with
great care and exactness in regard to the devotion paid
to our Lord’s Blessed Mother. Thus, after most carefully
explaining that there are two modes of “service
and worship” which differ not merely in degree, but
in kind and nature, and which were then, as now,
known under the terms <i>latria</i> and <i>dulia</i>, our author
proceeds, “Latria is a protestation and acknowledgment
of the high majesty of God; the recognition
that He is sovereign goodness, sovereign wisdom,
sovereign might, sovereign truth, sovereign justice;
that He is the Creator and Saviour of all creatures
and the end of all things; that all we have we have
of Him, and that without Him we have absolutely
nothing; and that without Him we can neither have
nor do anything, neither we nor any other creature.
This acknowledgment and protestation is made in three
ways: by the heart, and by word, and by deed. We
make it by the heart when we love Him as sovereign
goodness; when we love Him as sovereign wisdom
and truth, that may not deceive nor be deceived;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
when we hope in Him and trust Him as sovereign
might that can best help us in need; as sovereign
greatness and Lord, who may best yield us our
deserts; and as sovereign Saviour, most merciful and
most ready to forgive us our misdeeds.… Also the
acknowledgment is done in the prayer and praise of
our mouths.… For we must pray to Him and
praise Him as sovereign might, sovereign wisdom,
sovereign goodness, sovereign truth; as all-just and
merciful as the Maker and Saviour of all things, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“And in this manner we are not to pray to or
praise any creature. Therefore, they who make their
prayers and their praises before images, and say their
<i>Paternoster</i> and their <i>Ave Maria</i> and other prayers
and praises commonly used by holy Church, or any
such, if they do it to the image, and speak to the
image, they do open idolatry. Also they are not
excused even if they understand not what they say,
for their lights, and their other wits, and their inner
wit also, showeth them well that there ought that no
such prayer, praise, or worship be offered to such images,
for they can neither hear them, nor see them, nor help
them in their needs.”</p>

<p>Equally definite and explicit is another writer, just
on the eve of the Reformation. William Bond, the
brother of Sion, in 1531 published his large volume
of instructions called <i>The Pilgrymage of Perfeccyon</i>, to
which his contemporary, Richard Whitford, refers his
readers for the fullest teaching on sundry points of
faith and practice. In setting forth the distinction
between an <i>image</i> and an <i>idol</i> this authority says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
“Many nowadays take the Scripture wrongly, and
thereby fall into heresy as Wycliffe did with his
followers, and now this abominable heretic, Luther,
with his adherents.… And (as I suppose) the cause
of their error is some of these following:&mdash;First, that
they put no difference between an idol and an image;
secondly, that they put no difference between the service
or high adoration due to God, called in the Greek
tongue <i>latria</i>, and the lower veneration or worship exhibited
and done to the saints of God, called in Greek
<i>dulia</i>.… The veneration or worship that is done to
the images (as Damascene, Basil, and St. Thomas say)
rest not in them, but redound unto the thing that is
represented by such images: as for example, the great
ambassador or messenger of a king shall have the same
reverence that the king’s own person should have if
he were present. This honour is not done to this man
for himself, or for his own person, but for the king’s
person in whose name he cometh, and all such honour
and reverence so done redoundeth to the king and
resteth in him.… So it is in the veneration or worshipping
of the images of Christ and His saints. The
honour rests not in the image, nor in the stock, nor
in the stone, but in the thing that is represented thereby.”
According to St. Thomas, he says the images
in churches are intended to “be as books to the rude
and unlearned people,” and to “stir simple souls to
devotion.”<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Bond then draws out most carefully the distinction
which the Church teaches as to the kinds of honour
to be given to the saints. “Our lights, oblations, or
Paternosters and creeds that we say before images of
saints,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> “are as praisings of God, for His
graces wrought in His saints, by whose merits we
trust that our petitions shall be the sooner obtained
of God.… We pray to them, not as to the granters
of our petitions, but as means whereby we may the
sooner obtain the same.”<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Speaking specially of the reverence shown to the
crucifix, our author uses the teaching of St. Thomas
to explain the exact meaning of this honour. “The
Church in Lent, in the Passion time,” he continues,
“worships it, singing, ‘<i>O crux ave, spes unica</i>,’ ‘Hail,
holy cross, our only hope.’ That is to be understood
as ‘Hail, blessed Lord crucified, Who art our only
hope’&mdash;for all is one worship and act. Christ, our
Maker and Redeemer, God and man in one person,
is of duty worshipped with the high adoration only due
to God, called <i>latria</i>. His image also, or his similitude,
called the crucifix, is to be worshipped, just as the
Blessed Sacrament is adored with the worship of
<i>latria</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>To this testimony may be added that of another
passage from Sir Thomas More. He was engaged in
refuting the accusation made by Tyndale against the
religious practices of pre-Reformation days, to which
charges, unfortunately, people have given too much
credence in later times. “Now of prayer, Tyndale
says,” writes More,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> “that we think no man may pray
but at church, and that (<i>i.e.</i> the praying before a crucifix
or image) is nothing but the saying of a <i>Paternoster</i>
to a post. (Further) that the observances and ceremonies
of the Church are vain things of our own
imagination, neither needful to the taming of the flesh,
nor profitable to our neighbour, nor to the honour of
God. These lies come in by lumps; lo! I dare say
that he never heard in his life men nor women say
that a man might pray only in church. Just as true
is it also that men say their <i>Paternosters</i> to the post, by
which name it pleases him of his reverent Christian
mind to call the images of holy saints and our Blessed
Lady, and the figure of Christ’s cross, the book of His
bitter passion. Though we reverence these in honour
of the things they represent, and in remembrance of
Christ do creep to the cross and kiss it, and say <i>Paternoster</i>
at it, yet we say not our <i>Paternoster</i> to it, but to
God; and that Tyndale knows full well, but he likes to
rail.”<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>Finally a passage on the subject of pre-Reformation
devotion to the saints and angels, from the tract <i>Dives et
Pauper</i>, may fitly close this subject. “First,” says the
author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span> “worship ye our Lady, mother and maid, above
all, next after God, and then other saints both men and
women, and then the holy angels, as God giveth the
grace. Worship ye them not as God, but as our
tutors, defenders and keepers, as our leaders and
governors under God, as the means between us and
God, who is the Father of all and most Sovereign
Judge, to appease Him, and to pray for us, and to
obtain us grace to do well, and for forgiveness of
our misdeeds.… And, dear friend, pray ye heartily
to your angel, as to him that is nearest to you and
hath most care of you, and is, under God, most busy
to save you. And follow his governance and trust
in him in all goodness, and with reverence and purity
pray ye to him faithfully, make your plaints to him,
and speak to him homely to be your helper, since he
is your tutor and keeper assigned to you by God. Say
oft that holy prayer, <i>Angele qui meus est</i>, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>This prayer to the Guardian Angel, so highly commended,
was well known to pre-Reformation Catholics.
Generations of English mothers taught it to their
children; it is found frequently recommended in the
sermons of the fifteenth century, and confessors are
charged to advise their penitents to learn and make
use of it. For the benefit of those of my readers who
may not know the prayer, I here give it in an English
form, from a Latin version in the tract <i>Dextra Pars
Oculi</i>, which was intended to assist confessors in the
discharge of their sacred ministry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O angel who my guardian art,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Through God’s paternal love,</div>
<div class="verse">Defend, and shield, and rule the charge</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">In all my life be thou my stay,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is, of course, impossible here to do more than
refer to the books of instruction, and those intended to
furnish the priests on the eve of the Reformation with
material for the familiar teaching they were bound to
give their people. Such works as Walter Pagula’s <i>Pars
Oculi Sacerdotis</i>, and the <i>Pupilla Oculi</i> of John de Burgo,
both fourteenth-century productions, were in general
use during the fifteenth century among the clergy.
The frequent mention of these works in the inventories
and wills of the period shows that they were in great
demand, and were circulated from hand to hand, whilst
an edition of the latter, printed in 1510 by Wolffgang,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
at the expense of an English merchant, William Bretton,
attests its continued popularity. In a letter from
the editor, Augustine Aggeus, to Bretton, printed on
the back of the title-page, it is said that the <i>Pupilla</i> was
printed solely with the desire that the rites and sacraments
of the church might be better understood and
appreciated, and to secure “that nowhere in the English
Church” should there be any excuse of ignorance
on those matters.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The contents of the first-named tract, the <i>Pars
Oculi Sacerdotis</i>, show how very useful a manual it must
have been to assist the clergy in their ministrations. It
consists of three parts: the first portion forms what
would now be called the <i>praxis confessarii</i>, a manual for
instructing priests in the science of dealing with souls,
and giving examples of the kind of questions that should
be asked of various people, for example, of religious,
secular priests, merchants, soldiers, and the like. This
is followed by a detailed examination of conscience,
and pious practices are suggested for the priest to
recommend for the use of the faithful. For example,
in order that the lives of lay people might be associated
in some way with the public prayer of the church, the
Divine office, the priest is advised to get his penitents
to make use of the Pater and Creed, seven times a
day, to correspond with the canonical hours. Those
having the cure of souls are reminded that it is their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
duty to see that all at least know the Lord’s Prayer,
the Creed, and the Hail Mary by heart, and they are
urged to do all in their power to inculcate devotions to
our Lady, Patron Saints, and the Guardian Angels.</p>

<p>The second part of the <i>Dextra Pars Oculi</i> deals
minutely and carefully with the instructions which a
priest should give his people in their religion, and this
includes not only points of necessary belief and Christian
practice, but such matters as the proper decorum
and behaviour in Church, and the cemetery, &amp;c. The
materials for these familiar instructions are arranged
under thirty-one headings, and following on these are
the explanations of Christian faith and practice to be
made in the simple sermons the clergy were bound to
give to their people quarterly. The third part, called
the <i>Sinistra Pars Oculi</i>, is an equally careful treatise
on the sacraments. The instructions on the Blessed
Eucharist are excellent, and in the course of them many
matters of English religious practice are touched upon
and the ceremonies of the Mass are fully explained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that much of the real religious instruction
in pre-Reformation days, as indeed in all ages, had
to be given at home by parents to their children. The
daily practices by which the home life is regulated and
sanctified are more efficacious in the formation of early
habits of solid piety and the fear of God in the young
than any religious instructions given at school or at
Church. This was fully understood and insisted upon
in pre-Reformation books of instruction. Such, for
example, is the very purpose of Richard Whitford’s
book, called <i>A werke for Housholders, or for them that
have the guyding or governance of any company</i>, printed by
Wynkyn de Worde in 1534, and again by Robert
Redman in 1537. After reminding his readers that
life is short, and that it is impossible for any man to
know when he shall be called upon to give an account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
of his stewardship, he turns to the consideration of the
Christian’s daily life. Begin the day well, he says; on
first awakening, turn your thoughts and heart to God,
“and then use by continual custom to make a cross with
your thumb upon your forehead or front, whilst saying
these words, <i>In nomine Patris</i>; and another cross upon
your mouth, with these words, <i>Et filii</i>; and then a third
cross upon your breast, saying, <i>Et spiritus Sancti</i>.” After
suggesting a form of morning and evening prayer, and
urging a daily examination of conscience, he continues:
Some may object that all this is very well for religious,
or people secluded from the world, “but we lie two
or three sometimes together, and even in one chamber
divers beds, and so many in company, that if we should
use these things in the presence of our fellows some
would laugh us to scorn and mock at us.” But to
this objection Whitford in effect replies that at most it
would be a nine days’ wonder, and people would quickly
be induced to follow an example of such a good Christian
practice if set with courage and firmness.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of the duty of instructing others, “the
wretch of Syon,” as Whitford constantly calls himself,
urges those who can read to use their gifts for the
benefit of others not so fortunate. They should get
their neighbours together on holidays, he says, especially
the young, and teach them the daily exercise, and
in particular the “things they are bound to know or
can say: that is the <i>Paternoster</i>, the <i>Ave</i>, and the <i>Creed</i>.”
Begin early to teach those that are young, for “our
English proverb saith that the young cock croweth as
he doth hear and learn of the old.” Parents, above
all things, he urges to look well after their children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and to take care of the company they keep. Teach
them to say their grace at meals. “At every meal,
dinner or supper, I have advised, and do now counsel,
that one person should with loud voice say thus,
‘Paternoster,’ with every petition paraphrased and
explained, and the Hail Mary and Creed likewise.
This manner of the Paternoster, Ave, and Creed,” he
says, “I would have used and read from the book at
every meal, or at least once a day with a loud voice
that all the persons present may hear it.” People are
bound to see that all in their house know these prayers
and say them.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Very strongly indeed does Whitford in this volume
write against belief in charms and giving way to superstitions.
There is no question about his strong condemnation
of anything, however slight, which might
savour of reliance on these external things, and as an
instance of what he means, he declares that the application
of a piece of bread, with a cross marked upon it,
to a tooth to cure its aching, savours of superstition, as
showing too great a reliance on the material cross. In
the same place our author urges parents to correct
their children early for any use of oaths and strong
expressions. “Teach your children,” he says, “to
make their additions under this form: ‘yea, father,’
‘nay, father,’ ‘yea, mother,’ ‘nay, mother,’ and ever to
avoid such things as ‘by cock and pye,’ and ‘by my
hood of green,’ and such other.”<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Finally, to take but one more example of the
advice given in this interesting volume to parents and
others having the charge of the young, Whitford says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
“Teach your children to ask a blessing every night,
kneeling, before they go to rest, under this form:
‘Father, I beseech you a blessing for charity.’” If the
child is too stubborn to do this, he says let it “be well
whisked.” If too old to be corrected in this way, let it
be set out in the middle of the dining-room and made
to feed by itself, and let it be treated as one would
treat one who did not deserve to consort with its
fellows. Also teach the young “to ask a blessing
from every bishop, abbot, and priest, and of their godfathers
and godmothers also.”<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>In taking a general survey of the books issued by
the English presses upon the introduction of the art of
printing, the inquirer can hardly fail to be struck with
the number of religious, or quasi-religious, works which
formed the bulk of the early printed books. This fact
alone is sufficient evidence that the invention which at
this period worked a veritable revolution in the intellectual
life of the world, was welcomed by the ecclesiastical
authorities as a valuable auxiliary in the work of
instruction. In England the first presses were set up
under the patronage of churchmen, and a very large
proportion of the early books were actually works of
instruction or volumes furnishing materials to the clergy
for the familiar and simple discourses which they were
accustomed to give four times a year to their people.
Besides the large number of what may be regarded as
professional books chiefly intended for use by the
ecclesiastical body, such as missals, manuals, breviaries,
and horæ, and the prymers and other prayer-books used
by the laity, there was an ample supply of religious
literature published in the early part of the sixteenth
century. In fact, the bulk of the early printed English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
books were of a religious character, and as the publication
of such volumes was evidently a matter of business
on the part of the first English printers, it is obvious
that this class of literature commanded a ready sale,
and that the circulation of such books was fostered by
those in authority at this period. Volumes of sermons,
works of Instruction on the Creed and the Commandments,
lives of the saints, and popular expositions of
Scripture history, were not only produced but passed
through several editions in a short space of time. The
evidence, consequently, of the productions of the first
English printing-presses goes to show not only that
religious books were in great demand, but also that so
far from discouraging the use of such works of instruction,
the ecclesiastical authorities actively helped in
their diffusion.</p>

<p>In considering the religious education of the people
in the time previous to the great upheaval of the sixteenth
century, some account must be taken of the
village mystery plays which obviously formed no inconsiderable
part in popular instruction in the great truths
of religion. The inventories of parish churches and
the churchwardens’ accounts which have survived
show how very common a feature these religious plays
formed in the parish life of the fifteenth century, and
the words of the various dramas, of which we still
possess copies, show how powerful a medium of teaching
they would have been among the simple and unlettered
villagers of Catholic England, and even to
the crowds which at times thronged great cities like
Coventry and Chester, to be present at the more
elaborate plays acted in these traditional centres of
the religious drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>As to their popularity there can be no question.
Dramatic representations of the chief events in the life
of our Lord, &amp;c., were commonly so associated with
the religious purposes for which they were originally
produced, that they were played on Sundays and feast
days, and not infrequently in churches, church porches,
and churchyards. “Spectacles, plays, and dances that
are used on great feasts,” says the author of <i>Dives et
Pauper</i>, quoted above, “as they are done principally
for devotion and honest mirth, and to teach men to love
God the more, are lawful if the people be not thereby
hindered from God’s service, nor from hearing God’s
word, and provided that in such spectacles and plays
there is mingled no error against the faith of Holy
Church and good living. All other plays are prohibited,
both on holidays and work days (according
to the law), upon which the gloss saith that the representation
in plays at Christmas of Herod and the
Three Kings, and other pieces of the Gospel, both
then and at Easter and other times, is lawful and commendable.”</p>

<p>A few examples of the kind of teaching imparted in
these plays will give a better idea of the purpose they
served in pre-Reformation days than any description.
There can be no reasonable doubt that such dramatic
representations of the chief mysteries of religion and
of scenes in the life of our Lord or of His saints served
to impress these truths and events upon the imaginations
of the audiences who witnessed them, and to
make them vivid realities in a way which we, who
are not living in the same religious atmosphere, find
it difficult now to understand. The religious drama
was the handmaid of the Church, and was intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
to assist in instructing the people at large in the truths
and duties of religion, just as the paintings upon the
walls of the sacred buildings were designed to tell their
own tale of the Bible history, and form “a book” ever
open to the eyes of the unlettered children of the
Church, easy to be understood, graphically setting
forth events in the story of God’s dealings with
men, and illustrating truths which often formed
the groundwork for oral instruction in the Sunday
sermon.</p>

<p>Whatever we may be inclined to think of these
simple plays as literary works, or however we may
be inclined now to smile at some of the characters
and “situations,” as to the pious spirit which dictated
their composition and presided over their production
there can be no doubt. “In great devotion and discretion,”
says the monk and chronicler, “Higden
published the story of the Bible, that the simple in
their own language might understand.”<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>This was the motive of all these mediæval religious
plays. As a popular writer upon the English drama says:
“There is abundant evidence that the Romish ecclesiastics
in the mystery plays, especially that part of them
relating to the birth, passion, and resurrection of Christ,
had the perfectly serious intention of strengthening the
faith of the multitude in the fundamental doctrines of
the Church, and it seems the less extraordinary that
they should have resorted to this expedient when we
reflect that, before the invention of printing, books had
no existence for the people at large.”<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>The subjects treated of in these plays were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
varied, although those which were performed at the
great feasts of Christmas and Easter generally had some
relation to the mystery then celebrated. In fact, the
mystery plays of the sacred seasons were only looked
upon as helping to make men realise more deeply the
great drama of the Redemption, the memory of which
was perpetuated in the sequence of the great festivals
of the Christian year. In such a collection as that
known as the <i>Towneley Mysteries</i>, and published by the
Surtees Society, we have examples of the subjects
treated in the religious plays of the period. The collection
makes no pretence to be complete, but it comprises
some three and thirty plays, including such
subjects as the Creation, the death of Abel, the story
of Noah, the sacrifice of Isaac and other Old Testament
histories, and a great number of scenes from
the New Testament, such as the Annunciation, the
Visitation, Cæsar Augustus, scenes from the Nativity,
the Shepherds and the Magi, the Flight into Egypt,
various scenes from the Passion and Crucifixion, the
parable of the Talents, the story of Lazarus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Any one who will take the trouble to read these
plays as they are printed in this volume cannot fail
to be impressed not only with the vivid picture of the
special scene in the Old or New Testament that is
presented to the imagination, but by the extensive
knowledge of the Bible which the production of
these plays must have imparted to those who listened
to them, and by the way in which, incidentally, the
most important religious truths are conveyed in the
crude and rugged verse. Again and again, for instance,
the entire dependence of all created things
upon the Providence of Almighty God is declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and illustrated. Thus, the confession of God’s Omnipotence,
put into the mouth of Noah at the beginning
of the play of “Noah and his Sons,” contains a profession
of belief in the Holy Trinity and in the work of
the three Persons: it describes the creation of the
world, the fall of Lucifer, the sin of our first parents,
and their expulsion from Paradise. In the story of
Abraham, too, the prayer of the patriarch with which
it begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Adonai, thou God very,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou hear us when to Thee we call,</div>
<div class="verse">As Thou art He that best may,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou art most succour and help of all,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>gives a complete résumé of the Bible history before the
days of Abraham, with the purpose of showing that all
things are in the hands of God, and that complete obedience
is due to Him by all creatures whom He has
made.</p>

<p>The same teaching as to the entire dependence
of the Christian for all things upon God’s Providence
appears in the address of the soul to its Maker in
the “morality” of Mary Magdalene, printed by Mr.
Sharpe from the Digby Manuscript collection of
religious plays:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The more these old plays which delighted our
forefathers are examined, the more clear it becomes
that, although undoubtedly unlearned and unread, the
people in pre-Reformation days, with instruction such
as is conveyed in these pious dramas, must have had
a deeper insight into the Gospel narrative, and a more
thorough knowledge of Bible history generally, not to
speak of a comprehension of the great truths of
religion, than the majority of men possess now in
these days of boasted enlightenment. Some of the
plays, as for example that representing St. Peter’s
fall, exhibit a depth of genuine feeling, of humble
sorrow, for instance, on the part of St. Peter, and of
loving-kindness on the part of our Lord, which must
have come home to the hearts as well as to the minds
of the beholders. At the same time, the lesson deduced
by our Saviour from the apostle’s fall, namely, the
need of all learning by their own shortcomings to be
merciful to the trespasses of others, must have impressed
itself upon them with a force which would
not easily have been forgotten.</p>

<p>In that most popular of all representations&mdash;that
of Doomsday&mdash;“people learnt that before God there
is no distinction of persons, and that each individual
soul will be judged on its own merits, quite apart
from any fictitious human distinctions of rank, wealth,
or power.” Thus, as types, appear a <i>saved</i> pope,
emperor, king and queen, and amongst the <i>damned</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
we also find a pope, emperor, king and queen,
justiciar and merchant. And the words of thankfulness
uttered by the Pope that has obtained his crown
betrays “no self-satisfaction at the attainment of salvation;
on the contrary, the true ring of Christian
humility betokens a due appreciation of God’s unutterable
holiness, and our unworthiness to stand
before His face till the uttermost blemish left by sin
has been wiped away” by the healing fires of Purgatory.
No less clearly is the full doctrine of responsibility
taught in the lament of the Pope, who is
represented as having lost his soul by an evil life,
and as being condemned to eternal punishment. The
mere fact of a pope being so represented was in
itself, when the Office was held in the highest regard,
a lesson of the highest importance in the teaching
of the true principles of holiness. In a word, these
mystery plays provided a most useful means of impressing
upon the minds of all the facts of Bible
history, the great truths of religion, and the chief
Christian virtues. The people taught in such a school
and the people who delighted in such representations,
as our forefathers in pre-Reformation days unquestionably
did, cannot, even from this point of view alone, be
regarded as ignorant of scriptural or moral teaching.</p>

<span class="smaller">PARISH LIFE IN CATHOLIC ENGLAND</span></h2>

<p>To understand the attitude of men’s minds to the
ecclesiastical system on the eve of the great religious
changes of the sixteenth century, some knowledge of
the parochial life of Catholic England is necessary.
Under present conditions, when unity has given place
to diversity, and three centuries of continuous wrangling
“over secret truths which most profoundly affect the
heart and mind” have done much to coarsen and
deaden our spiritual sense; when the religious mind
of England manifests every shade of belief and unbelief
without conscious reflection on the logical absurdity of
the position, it is by no means easy to realise the influence
of a state of affairs when all men, from the
highest to the lowest, in every village and hamlet
throughout the length and breadth of the land, had
but one creed, worshipped their Maker in but one way,
and were bound together with what most certainly
were to them the real and practical ties of the Christian
brotherhood. It is hardly possible to overestimate the
effect of surroundings upon individual opinion, or the
influence of a congenial atmosphere both on the growth
and development of a spirit of religion and on the
preservation of Christian morals and religious practices
generally. When all, so far as religious faith is concerned,
thought the same, and when all, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
religious observance is concerned, did the same, the
very atmosphere of unity was productive of that spirit
of common brotherhood, which appears so plainly in
the records of the period preceding the religious revolt
of the sixteenth century. Those who will read below
the surface and will examine for themselves into the
social life of that time must admit, however much they
feel bound to condemn the existing religious system,
that it certainly maintained up to the very time of
its overthrow a hold over the minds and hearts of
the people at large, which nothing since has gained.
Religion overflowed, as it were, into popular life, and
helped to sanctify human interests, whilst the affection
of the people was manifested in a thousand ways in
regard to what we might now be inclined to consider
the ecclesiastical domain. Whether for good or evil,
religion in its highest and truest sense, at least as it
was then understood, was to the English people as the
bloom upon the choicest fruit. Whatever view may
be taken as to advantage or disadvantage which came
to the body politic, or to individuals, by the Reformation,
it must be admitted that at least part of the price
paid for the change was the destruction of the sense
of corporate unity and common brotherhood, which
was fostered by the religious unanimity of belief and
practice in every village in the country, and which, as
in the main-spring of its life, and the very central
point of its being, centred in the Church with its rites
and ceremonies.</p>

<p>A Venetian traveller at the beginning of the sixteenth
century bears witness to the influence of religion
upon the English people of that time. His opinion is
all the more valuable, inasmuch as he appeals to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
experience of his master, who was also the companion
of his travels, to confirm his own impressions, and as
he was fully alive to the weak points in the English
character, of which he thus records his opinion: “The
English are great lovers of themselves and of everything
belonging to them; they think that there are no
other men but themselves and no other world but
England. Whenever they see a handsome foreigner
they say that ‘he looks like an Englishman,’ or that
‘it is a great pity that he should not be an Englishman,’
and when they partake of any delicacy with a
foreigner they ask him whether such a thing is made
in his country.”<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> In regard to the religious practices
of the people, this intelligent foreigner says, “They all
attend mass every day, and say many <i>Paternosters</i> in
public. The women carry long rosaries in their hands,
and any who can read take the Office of Our Lady
with them, and with some companion recite it in
Church verse by verse, in a low voice, after the
manner of churchmen. On Sundays they always hear
Mass in their parish church and give liberal alms,
because they may not offer less than a piece of money
of which fourteen are equivalent to a golden ducat.
Neither do they omit any form incumbent on good
Christians.”<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>In these days perhaps the suggestion that the
English people commonly in the early sixteenth century
were present daily at morning Mass is likely to be
received with caution, and classed among the strange
tales proverbially told by travellers, then as now. It
is, however, confirmed by another Venetian who visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
England some few years later, and who asserts that
every morning “at daybreak he went to Mass arm-in-arm
with some English nobleman or other.”<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> And,
indeed, the same desire of the people to be present
daily at the Sacrifice of the Mass is attested by Archbishop
Cranmer when, after the change had come, he
holds up to ridicule the traditional observances previously
in vogue. What he specially objected to was
the common practice of those who run, as he says,
“from altar to altar, and from sacring, as they call it,
to sacring, peeping, tooting, and gazing at that thing
which the priest held up in his hands … and saying,
‘this day have I seen my Maker,’ and ‘I cannot be
quiet except I see my Maker once a day.’”<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>If there were no other evidence of the affection
of the English people on the eve of the Reformation
for their religion, that of the stone walls of the churches
would be sufficient to prove the sincerity of their love.
In the whole history of English architecture nothing is
more remarkable than the activity in church building
manifested during the later half of the fifteenth and
the early part of the sixteenth centuries. From one
end of England to the other in the church walls are to
be seen the evidences of thought and skill, labour and
wealth, spent freely upon the sacred buildings during
a period when it might not unnaturally have been
thought that the civil dissensions of the Wars of the
Roses, and the consequent destruction of life and
property, would have been fatal to enterprise in the
field of church building and church decoration and
enrichment. It is not in any way an exaggeration to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
say that well-nigh every village church in England can
show signs of this marvellous activity, whilst in many
cases there is unmistakable evidence of personal care
and thought in the smallest details.</p>

<p>No less remarkable than the extent of this movement
is the source from which the money necessary
for all the work upon the cathedrals and parish churches
of the country came. In previous centuries, to a
great extent churches and monastic buildings owed
their existence and embellishment mainly to the individual
enterprise of the powerful nobles or rich
ecclesiastics; but from the middle of the fifteenth
century the numerous, and, in many cases, even vast
operations, undertaken in regard to ecclesiastical buildings
and ornamentation, were the work of the people
at large, and were mainly directed by their chosen
representatives. At the close of the fifteenth century,
church work was in every sense of the word a
popular work, and the wills, inventories, and churchwardens’
accounts prove beyond question that the people
generally contributed generously according to their
means, and that theirs was the initiative, and theirs
the energetic administration by which the whole was
accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Gifts of money and valuables, bequests
of all kinds, systematic collections by parish officials, or
by directors of guilds, often extending over considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
periods, and the proceeds of parish plays and parish
feasts, were the ordinary means by which the sums
necessary to carry out these works of building and
embellishment were provided. Those who had no
money to give brought articles of jewellery, such as
rings, brooches, buckles, and the like, or articles of
dress or of domestic utility, to be converted into vestments,
banners, and altar hangings to adorn the images
and shrines, to make the sacred vessels of God’s house, or
to be sold for like purposes. For the same end, and
to secure the perpetuity of lamps before the Blessed
Sacrament, or lights before the altars of saints, people
gave houses and lands into the care of the parish
officials, or made over to them cattle and sheep to
be held in trust, which, when let out at a rent,
formed a permanent endowment for the furtherance
of these sacred purposes.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the period with which we are concerned
was not merely an age of building, but an age
of decoration, and of decoration which may almost
be described as “lavish.” The very architecture of
the time is proof of the wealth of ornament with which
men sought to give expression to their enthusiastic
love of the Houses of God, which they had come to
regard as the centre of their social no less than of
their religious life. Flowing lines in tracery and arch
moulding gave place to straight lines, groined roofs
were enriched by extra ribs, and panels of elaborate
work covered the plain surfaces of former times; the
very key-stones of the vaulting became pendants, and
the springers branched out like palm trees, forming
that rich and entirely English variety of groin called
“fan-tracery,” such as we see at Sherborne, Eton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
King’s College, Cambridge, and Henry VII.’s Chapel
at Westminster. “In other respects,” says a modern
writer, “the architects of the fifteenth century were
very successful. Few things can be seen more beautiful
than the steeples of Gloucester Cathedral and
St. Mary’s, Taunton. The open roofs, as for example
that of St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, are superb, and
finally they have left us a large number of enormous
parish churches all over the country, full of interesting
furniture and decoration.”</p>

<p>The fact is, that this was the last expression of Gothic
as a living art. The builders and beautifiers of the
English churches on the eve of the religious changes
spoke still a living language, and their works still tell
us of the fulness of the hearts which planned and
executed such works. It is somewhat difficult for us
to understand this, when living in an age of imitation,
and at a time when architecture has no longer a language
of its own. “Imitation,” writes Mr. Ferguson,
“is in fact all we aim at in the architectural art of
the present day. We entrust its exercise to a specially
educated class, most learned in the details of the style
they are called upon to work in, and they produce
buildings which delight the scholars and archæologists
of the day, but which the less educated classes neither
understand nor appreciate, and which will lose their
significance the moment the fashion which produced
them has passed away.</p>

<p>“The difference between this artificial state of
things and the practice of a true style will not be
difficult to understand. When, for instance, Gothic
was a living art in England, men expressed themselves
in it as in any other part of the vernacular. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
was done was a part of the usual, ordinary every-day
life, and men had no more difficulty in understanding
what others were doing than in comprehending what
they were saying. A mason did not require to be
a learned man to chisel what he had carved ever since
he was a boy, and what alone he had seen being done
during his lifetime, and he adapted new forms just in
the same manner and as naturally as men adapt new
modes of expression in language as they happen to be
introduced, without even remarking it. At that time
any educated man could design in Gothic Art, just as
any man who can read and write can now compose and
give utterance to any poetry or prose that may be in him.</p>

<p>“Where art is a true art, it is naturally practised and
as easily understood, as a vernacular literature of which,
indeed, it is an essential and most expressive part, and
so it was in Greece and Rome, and so, too, in the Middle
Ages. But with us it is little more than a dead corpse,
galvanised into spasmodic life by a few selected practitioners
for the amusement and delight of a small section
of the specially educated classes. It expresses truthfully
neither our wants nor our feelings, and we ought not
to be surprised how very unsatisfactory every modern
building really is, even when executed by the most
talented architects as compared with the productions
of our village mason or parish priest at an age when
men sought only to express clearly what they felt
strongly, and sought to do it only in their natural
mother tongue, untrammelled by the fetters of a dead
or familiar foreign form of speech.”<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>To any one who will examine the churchwardens’
accounts of the period previous to the religious changes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the truth of the above quotation will clearly appear.
Then, if ever, ecclesiastical art and architecture was
the living expression of popular feeling and popular
love of religion, and the wholesale destruction of
ancient architectural monuments throughout the land,
the pulling down of rood and screen and image, the
casting down of monuments sacred to the memory of
the best and holiest and most venerated names in the
long roll of English men of honour, the breaking up of
stone-work and metal-work upon which the marks of
the chisel of the mason and graver were yet fresh, the
whitewash daubed over paintings which had helped to
make the parish churches objects of beauty and interest
to the people, the ruthless smashing of the pictured
window lights, and the pillage of the sacred vessels and
vestments and hangings, which the people and their
fathers had loved to provide for God’s service&mdash;all this
and much more of the same kind, the perhaps inevitable
accompaniments of the religious change, was nothing
less to the people than proscription by authority of the
national language of art and architecture, such as they
had hitherto understood it. And never probably had
the language been more truly the language of the people
at large. For reasons just assigned, the work of church
building and church decoration, and the provision of
vestments and plate, the care of the fabric and the very
details of things necessary for the church services, were
in the hands of the people. The period in question had
given rise to the great middle class, and here, as in
Germany, the burgher folk, the merchants and traders,
began literally to lavish their gifts in adornment of their
parish churches, and to vie one with another in the
profusion of their generosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult for us, as we look upon the
generally bare and unfurnished churches that have been
left to us as monuments of the past about which we are
concerned, to realise what they must have been before
what a modern writer has fitly called “the great pillage”
commenced. All, from the great minsters and cathedral
churches down to the poorest little village sanctuary,
were in those days simply overflowing with wealth and
objects of beauty which loving hands had gathered
together to adorn God’s house, and to make it the best
and brightest spot in their little world, and so far as
their means would allow the very pride of their hearts.
This is no fancy picture. The inventories of English
churches in this period when compared, say, with those
of Italy, reveal the fact that the former were in every
way incomparably better furnished than the latter.
The Venetian traveller in England in 1500 was impressed
by this very thing during his journeyings
throughout the country. He notes and comments
upon the great sums of money regularly given to the
church as a matter of course by Englishmen of all
sorts. Then after speaking of the important wealth
of the country as evidenced by the silver plate possessed
by all but the poorest in the land, he continues:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
“But above all are their riches displayed in the
church treasures, for there is not a parish church in the
kingdom so mean as not to possess crucifixes, candlesticks,
censers, patens and cups of silver, nor is there a
convent of mendicant friars so poor as not to have all
these same articles in silver, besides many other ornaments
worthy of a cathedral church in the same metal.
Your magnificence may therefore imagine what the
decorations of those enormously rich Benedictine, Carthusian,
and Cistercian monasteries must be.… I
have been informed that amongst other things many of
these monasteries possess unicorns’ horns of an extraordinary
size. I have also been told that they have some
splendid tombs of English saints, such as St. Oswald,
St. Edmund, and St. Edward, all kings and martyrs.
I saw, one day being with your magnificence, at Westminster,
a place out of London, the tomb of that saint,
King Edward the Confessor, in the church of the foresaid
place, Westminster; and indeed, neither St. Martin
of Tours, a church in France, which I have heard is
one of the richest in existence, nor anything else that
I have ever seen, can be put into comparison with it.
The magnificence of the tomb of St. Thomas the
Martyr, Archbishop of Canterbury, surpasses all belief.”</p>

<p>Our present concern, however, is not with the
greater churches of the kingdom, but with the parish
churches which were scattered in such profusion all
over the country. An examination of such parochial
accounts as are still preserved affords an insight into
the working of the parish, and evidences the care
taken by the people to maintain and increase the
treasures of their churches. What is most remarkable
about the accounts that remain, which are, of
course, but the scanty survivals from the wreck, is
their consistent tenor. They one and all tell the
same story of general and intelligent interest taken
by the people as a whole in the beautifying and
supporting of their parish churches. In a very real
sense, that seems strange to us now, it was <i>their</i>
church; their life centred in it, and they were intimately
concerned in its working and management.
The articles of furniture and plate, the vestments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and hangings had a well-known history, and were
regarded as&mdash;what in truth they were&mdash;the common
property of every soul in the particular village or district.
Such accounts as we are referring to prove that specific
gifts and contributions continued to flow in an ample
stream to the churches from men and women of every
sort and condition up to the very eve of the great
religious changes.</p>

<p>From these and similar records we may learn a
good deal about parochial life and interests in the
closing period of the old ecclesiastical system. The
church was the common care and business. Its
welfare was the concern of the people at large, and
took its natural place in their daily lives. Was there
any building to be done, a new peal of bells to be
procured, the organs to be mended, new plate to be
bought, or the like, it was the parish as a corporate
body that decided the matter, arranged the details, and
provided for the payment. At times, say for example
when a new vestment was in question, the whole parish
would be called to sit in council in the church house
upon this matter of common interest, and discuss the
cost, and stuff, and make.</p>

<p>To take some examples: the inventory of Cranbrook
parish church for 1509 shows that all benefactors were
regularly noted down on a roll of honour, that their
gifts might be known and remembered. The presents,
of course, vary greatly in value: thus, there was a
monstrance of silver and gilt of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> “value of £20,
of Sir Robert Egelonby’s gift; which Sir Robert was
John Roberts’ priest thirty years, and he never had
other service nor benefice; and the said John Roberts
was father to Walter Roberts, Esquire.” And the foresaid
Sir Robert gave also to the common treasury of
the parish “two candlesticks of silver and twenty marks
of old nobles.” Again John Hendely “gave three copes
of purple velvet, whereof one was of velvet upon velvet
with images broidered,” and, adds the inventory, “for
a perpetual memory of this deed of goodness to the
common purposes of the parish church, his name is to
be read out to the people on festival days.” “He is
grandfather of Gervase Hendely of Cushorn, and of
Thomas of Cranbrook Street.” Or once more, it is
recorded that “old mother Hopper” gave the “two
long candlesticks before Our Lady’s altar, fronted with
lions, and a towel on the rood of Our Lady’s chancel.”</p>

<p>So, too, the inventory of the church goods of St.
Dunstan’s, Canterbury, includes a wonderful list of
furniture, plate, and vestments to which the names of
the donors are attached. Thus, the best chalice was
the gift of one “Harry Bole”; the two great candlesticks
of laten of John Philpot; and “a kercher for Our
Lady and a chapplet and a powdryd cap for her Son,”
the gift of Margery Roper.</p>

<p>The memory of these gifts was kept alive among the
people by the “bede-roll” or list of those for whom
the parish was bound to pray in return for their benefactions
to the public good. Thus to take an example:
at Leverton, in the county of Lincoln, the parson, Sir
John Wright, presented the church with a suit of red
purple vestments, “for the which,” says the note in the
churchwardens’ accounts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> “you shall all specially pray
for the souls of William Wright and Elizabeth his wife
(father and mother of the donor), and for the soul of
Sir William Wright, their son, and for the soul of Sir
John, sometime parson of this place, and for the souls of
Richard Wright and Isabel his wife, John Trowting and
Helen his wife, and for all benefactors, as well them
that be alive as them that be departed to the mercy of
God, for whose lives and souls are given here (these vestments)
to the honour of God, His most blessed Mother,
Our Lady Saint Mary, and all His Saints in Heaven, and
the blessed matron St. Helen his patron, to be used at
such principal feasts and times as it shall please the
curates as long as they shall last. For all these souls
and all Christian souls you shall say one Paternoster.”<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>In this way the memory of benefactors and their
good deeds was ever kept alive in the minds of those
who benefited by their gifts. The parish treasury was
not to them so much stock, the accumulation of years,
without definite history or purpose; but every article,
vestment, banner, hanging, and chalice, and the rest
called for the affectionate memories of both the living
and the dead. On high day and festival, when the
church was decked with all that was best and richest in
the parochial treasury, the display of the parish ornaments
recalled to the mind of the people assembled
within its walls the memory of good deeds done by
neighbours for the common good. “The immense
treasures in the churches,” writes Dr. Jessop, “were the
joy and boast of every man and woman and child in
England, who day by day and week by week assembled
to worship in the old houses of God which they and their
fathers had built, and whose every vestment and chalice
and candlestick and banner, organs and bells and picture
and image and altar and shrine, they looked upon
as their own and part of their birthright.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>What seems so strange about the facts revealed to
us in these church accounts of bygone times is that,
where now we might naturally be inclined to look for
poverty and meanness, there is evidence of the contrary,
so far as the parish church is concerned. Even when
the lives of the parishioners were spent in daily labours
to secure the bare necessities of life, and the village was
situated in the most out-of-the-way part of the country,
the sordid surroundings of a hard life find no counterpart
in the parish accounts so far as the church is concerned,
but even under such unfavourable circumstances
there is evidence of a taste for things of art and beauty,
and of both the will and power to procure them. To
take some examples: Morebath was a small uplandish
parish of no importance lying within the borders of
Devon, among the hills near the sources of the river Exe.
The population was scanty, and worldly riches evidently
not abundant. Morebath may, consequently, be taken
as a fair sample of an obscure and poor village community.
For this hamlet we possess fairly full accounts
for the close of the period under consideration, namely,
from the year 1530. At this time, in this poor place,
there were no less than eight separate accounts kept of
money intended for the support of different altars, or
for carrying out definite decorations, such as, for
example, the chapels of St. George and Our Lady,
and the guilds of the young men and maidens of the
parish. To the credit of these various accounts, or
“stores,” as they are called, are entered numerous gifts
of money, or articles of value, and even of kind, like
cows and swarms of bees. Most of them are possessed
of cattle and sheep, the proceeds from the rent of which
form a considerable portion of their endowment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
accounts as a whole furnish abundant evidence of active
and intelligent interest in the support and adornment of
the parish church on the part of the people at large.
Voluntary rates to clear off obligations contracted for
the benefit of the community, such as the purchase of
bells, the repair of the fabric, or even the making of
roads and bridges, were raised. Collections for Peter’s
pence, for the support of the parish clerk, and for various
other church purposes, are recorded, and the spirit of
self-help is evidenced in every line of these records. In
1528 the vicar gave up his rights to certain wool tithes
in order to purchase a complete set of black vestments,
which were only finished and paid for, at the cost of
£6, 5s. 0d., in 1547. In the year 1538, the parish
made a voluntary rate to purchase a new cope, and the
collection for the purpose secured £3, 6s. 8d. When
in 1534 the silver chalice was stolen, “ye yong men
and maydens of ye parysshe dru themselffe together,
and at ther gyfts and provysyon they bought in another
chalice without any charge of the parysshe.” Sums of
money big and small, specific gifts in kind, the stuff or
ornaments needed for vestments, were apparently always
forthcoming when occasion required. Thus at one
time a new cope is suggested, and Anne Tymwell of
Hayne gave the churchwardens her “gown and ring,”
Joan Tymwell a cloak and girdle, and Richard Norman
“seven sheep and three shillings and four pence in
money,” towards the expenses. At another time it is a
set of black vestments; at another a chalice; at another
a censer; but whatever it was, the people were evidently
ready and desirous of taking their share in the common
work of the parish. In 1529 the wardens state that
Elinor Nicoll gave to the store of St. Sydwell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
wedding-ring&mdash;“the which ring,” they add, “did help to
make Saint Sydwell’s shoes.” Then she gave to “the
store of Jesus” a little silver cross, parcel gilt, of the
value of 4d. In 1537 there is one item which deserves
to be noted, as it records the arrival of a piece of spoil
from Barlinch Abbey Church, which was dissolved by
the king’s orders the previous year. “Memorandum,”
runs the entry, “Hugh Poulett gave to the church
one of the glass windows of the Barlinch, with the
iron and stone and all the price” for setting it up.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>To understand the working of the pre-Reformation
parish, it is necessary to enter in detail into some one
of the accounts that are still preserved to us. We may
conveniently take those of Leverton in Lincolnshire,
printed in the <i>Archæologia</i>, which commence in the
year 1492. It is well to note, however, that the same
story of self-help and the same evidence of a spirit of
affection for the parish church and its services, is manifested
in every account of this kind we possess. It
must be remembered that it was popular government
in a true sense that then regulated all parochial matters.
Every adult of both sexes had a voice in this system of
self-government, and what cannot fail to strike the
student of these records is that, in the management of
the fabric, in the arrangements for the services, and all
things necessary for the due performance of these, diocesan
authorities evidently left to the parish itself a wise
discretion. No doubt the higher ecclesiastical officials
could interfere in theory, but in practice such interference
was rare. If the means necessary to carry out
repairs and keep the church in an efficient state, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
as to fabric and ornaments, were apparently never
wanting, it must be borne in mind that it was then
regarded as a solemn duty binding on the conscience of
each parishioner to maintain the House of God and the
parochial services. Bishop Hobhouse, from an examination
of the churchwardens’ accounts for some parishes
in Somerset, is able to describe the various ways in
which the parochial exchequer was replenished. First,
there were the voluntary rates, called “setts,” and these,
though voluntary in the sense that their imposition
depended on the will of the people at large, when
once the parish had declared for the rate, all were
bound to pay. Then the mediæval church authorities
cultivated various methods of eliciting the goodwill
of the people, and after prohibiting work on Sundays
and certain festivals, busied themselves with the finding
of amusements. Amongst these were the parish feasts
and church ales, at which collections for various public
purposes were made, which, together with the profits
made from such entertainments by those who managed
them for the benefit of the public purse, formed one of
the chief sources of parochial income. Beyond this,
the principle of association was thoroughly understood
and carried out in practice in the village and town communities.
People banded themselves together in religious
guilds and societies, the <i>raison d’être</i> of which was
the maintenance of special decorations at special altars,
the support of lamps and lights, or the keeping of obits
and festivals. These societies, moreover, became the
centres of organisation of any needed special collections,
and from their funds, or “stores” as they were called,
they contributed to the general expenses of maintaining
the fabric and the services. Popular bounty was, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
elicited by means of the “bede-roll,” or list of
public benefactors, for whom the prayers of the parishioners
were asked in the church on great festivals.
On this list of honour, all&mdash;even the poorest&mdash;were
anxious that their names should appear, and that their
memory be kept and their souls prayed for in the House
of God which they had loved in life. Even more than
money, which in those days, especially in out-of-the-way
places, was not over plentiful, the churchwardens’
accounts show that specific gifts of all kinds, either to
be sold for the profit of the purpose for which they
were bestowed, or to form a permanent part of the
church treasury, were common in pre-Reformation times.</p>

<p>Added to these sources of income were the profits
of trade carried on in the “church house.” Besides the
church itself, the wardens’ accounts testify to the existence
of a church house, if not as a universal feature in
mediæval parish life, at least as a very common one.
It was the parish club-house&mdash;the centre of parochial
life and local self-government; the place where the
community would assemble for business and pleasure.
It was thus the focus of all the social life of the parish,
and the system was extending in influence and utility up
to the eve of the great religious changes which put an
end to the popular side of parochial life. At Tintinhull,
a small village in Somerset, for example, the accounts
help us to trace the growth of this parish club-house.
Beginning as a place for making the altar bread, it
developed into a bakery for the supply of the community.
It then took up the brewing of beer to supply
the people and the church ales and similar parish festivals.
This soon grew into the brewing of beer to supply
those who required a supply, and at the same time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
oven and brewing utensils were let out to hire to private
persons. In the reign of Henry VII. a house was bought
by the wardens for parish purposes, and one Agnes Cook
was placed in it to manage it for the common benefit.
In 1533 it was in full swing as a parish club-house,
used for business and pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The “ale”&mdash;the
forerunner of the wardens’ “charity dinner”&mdash;was the
ordinary way of raising money to meet extraordinary
expenses; and as an incidental accompaniment came
invitations to other parishes in the neighbourhood, and
we find items charged for the expenses of churchwardens
attending at other parochial feasts, and the
sums they there put into the collection plate.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the parish, as a corporate body generally,
if not invariably, possessed property in land and
houses, which was administered by the people’s wardens
for the public good. The annual proceeds lightened
the common burdens, as indeed it was intended that
they should. A further source of occasional income
was found in the parish plays which were managed for
the common profit. Very frequently the production
was entrusted to some local guild, and the expenses of
mounting were advanced by the parochial authorities,
who not infrequently had amongst the church treasures
the dress and other stage properties necessary for the
proper productions. At Tintinhull, in Somerset, for
instance, in 1451, five parishioners got up a Christmas
play for the benefit of the fund required for the erection
of the new rood loft. At Morebath there was an Easter
play representing the Resurrection of our Lord, to
defray the expenses incurred by the parish on some
extensive repairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>With this general notion of the working of pre-Reformation
parochial accounts, we are now in a
position to turn by way of a particular example to those
of Leverton. The village is situated about six miles from
Boston. The church, until the neglect of the past three
hundred years had disfigured it, must have been very
beautiful when decked with the furniture and ornaments
which the loving care of the people of the
neighbourhood had collected within its walls. When
first the accounts open in 1492, the parish was beginning
to be interested, as indeed, by the way, so many
parishes were at this period, in the setting up of a new
peal of bells. The people had evidently made a great
effort to get these, and they contributed most generously.
The rector promised ten shillings and sixpence&mdash;which
sum, by the way, some one paid for him&mdash;but
the whole arrangement for the purchase and hanging
of the bells was in the hands of the churchwardens.
The bell chamber was mended and timber was bought
to strengthen the framework. When this was ready,
the great bell was brought over from the neighbouring
town, and money is disbursed for the carriage and the
team of horses, not forgetting a penny for the toll in
crossing a bridge. One William Wright of Benington
came over professionally to superintend the hanging
and “trossyng” of this great service bell. We may
judge, however, that it was not altogether satisfactory,
for in 1498 the two wardens made a “move” to “the
gathering of the township of Leverton in the kirk,” in
which they collected £4, 13s. 0d., and they forthwith
commenced again the building of a steeple for another
set of bells. The stone was given to them, but they
had to see to the work of quarrying it, and to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
business of collecting material and of building. Trees
in a neighbouring wood were bought, were cut and
carried, and sawn into beams and boards, and poles
were selected for scaffolding. Lime was burnt and
sand was dug for the mortar, and tubs were purchased
to mix it in, whilst Wreth, the carpenter, was retained
to look after the building in general, and the timberwork
of the new belfry in particular.</p>

<p>This seems to have exhausted the parish exchequer
for a year or two, but in 1503 the two wardens attended
at Boston to see their bell “shot,” and to provide for
its transport to Leverton. Here Richard Messur, the
local blacksmith, had prepared the necessary bolts and
locks to fasten it to the swinging beam, and he was in
attendance professionally to see the bell hung, with
John Red, the bellmaker of Boston, who, moreover,
remained for a time to teach the parish men how to
ring a peal upon their new bells.</p>

<p>As the sixteenth century progressed, a great deal
of building and repairs was undertaken by the parish
authorities. In 1503, a new font was ordered, and a
deputation went to Frieston, about three miles from
Leverton, to inspect and pass the work. The lead for
the lining was procured, and it was cast on the spot.
In 1517, repairs on the north side of the church were
undertaken, and these must have been extensive, judging
from the cost of the timber employed to shore up
the walls during the progress of the work. Two years
later, on the completion of these extensive building
operations, which had been going on for some time,
the church and churchyard were consecrated at a cost
to the public purse of £3. In 1526, the rood loft was
decorated, and the niches intended for images of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
saints, but which had hitherto been vacant, were filled.
One of the parishioners, William Frankish, in that year
left a legacy of 46s. 8d. for the purpose. The wardens
hired a man, called sometimes “the alabaster man,” and
sometimes “Robert Brook the carver,” and in earnest for
the seventeen images of alabaster of the rood loft they
gave him a shilling. At the same time a collection was
made for the support of the artist during his stay; some
of the parishioners gave money, but most of them apparently
contributed “cheese” for his use.</p>

<p>So much with regard to the serious building operations
which were continued up to the very eve of the Reformation.
They by no means occupied all the energies
of the parish officials. If the books required binding, a
travelling workman was engaged on the job, and leather,
thread, wax, and other necessary materials were purchased
for the work; the binder’s wife was paid extra
for stitching, and he was apparently lodged by one of
the townspeople as a contribution to the common work.
Then there were vestments to be procured, and surplices
and other church linen to be made, washed, and marked;
the very marks, by the way, being given in the accounts.
So entirely was the whole regarded as the work of the
people, that just as we have seen how the parish paid for
the consecration of their parish church and graveyard,
so did they pay a fee to their own vicar for blessing
the altar linen and the new vestments, and entering
the names of benefactors on the parish bede-roll.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>Details such as these, which might be multiplied to
any extent, make it abundantly clear that the church
was the centre and soul of village life in pre-Reformation
times, and that up to the very eve of the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
revolution it had not lost its place in the hearts of the
people. In this connection it is useful to bear in mind,
though somewhat difficult to realise, inasmuch as it is
now too foreign to our modern experience, that in the
period about which we are concerned the “parish”
meant the whole community of a well-defined area
“organised for church purposes and subject to church
authority.” In such a district, writes Bishop Hobhouse,
“every resident was a parishioner, and, as such, owed his
duty of confession and submission to the official guidance
of a stated pastor. There was no choice allowed.
The community was completely organised with a constitution
which recognised the rights of the whole and
of every adult member to a voice of self-government
when assembled for consultation under” their parish
priest.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> In this way the church was the centre of all
parish life, in a way now almost inconceivable. “From
the font to the grave,” says an authority on village life at
this time, “the greater number of the people lived
within the sound of its bells. It provided them with
all the consolations of religion, and linked itself with
such amusements as it did not directly supply.”<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>The writer of the above words was specially interested
in the accounts of the parish of St. Dunstan in the
city of Canterbury, and some few notes on those accounts
founded upon his preface may usefully be added
to what has already been said. The parochial authorities
evidently were possessed of considerable power
either by custom or consent over the inhabitants. In
St. Dunstan’s, for example, somewhere about 1485,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
there was some disagreement between a man named
Baker and the parish, and an item of 2½d. appears
in the accounts as spent on the arbitration that settled
it. Later on, two families fell out, and the vicar and a
jury of four parishioners met in council to put an end
to what was considered a scandal. A parish so managed
had necessarily some place in which the inhabitants of
the district could meet, and this in St. Dunstan’s is called
the <i>church house</i>, and sometimes the <i>parish house</i>. It is
frequently mentioned in the matters of repairs, &amp;c., and
two dozen trenchers and spoons, the property of the
parish, were placed there for use at the common feasts,
and for preparation of food distributed to the poor.
The annual dinner is named in the accounts, and there
is no doubt the young people too had dancing, bowling,
and other games, while “the ancients sat gravely by.”</p>

<p>The money needed for the repairs of the fabric and
for parish work generally was here collected by the
various brotherhoods connected with the church.
Some wore “scutchons” or badges to show that they
were authorised to beg. These brotherhoods were
possessed of more than money; malt, wheat, barley,
besides parish sheep and parish cows let out to the
highest bidder, are mentioned in the accounts as belonging
to them. One Nicholas Reugge, for example, left
four cows to the people of the parish to free them
for ever from the cost of supplying the “paschal,” or
great Easter candle. These four cows were valued by
the churchwardens at 10s. apiece, and were each let at
a rent of 2s. a year. In 1521, one John Richardson
rented five-and-twenty of the parish sheep, and the
wardens received rent of lambs, wool, &amp;c. The chief
of the brotherhoods connected with St. Dunstan’s was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
that named the “Schaft,” and it had the principal voice
in the ultimate management of parochial affairs. Besides
this, however, there were many other associations, such
as that of St. Anne for women and that of St. John for
youths, and various wardens were appointed to collect
the money necessary to keep the various lights, such as
St. Anne’s light, St. John’s light, St. Katherine’s light,
and the light of the Holy Rood. “These things,” writes
the editor of these interesting accounts, “all go to show
what life and activity there was in this little parish, which
never wanted willing men to devote their time and influence
to the management of their own affairs.”</p>

<p>The parish was small, numbering perhaps hardly
more than 400 souls. “But if small,” says the same
authority, “it was thoroughly efficient, and the religious
and intellectual work was as actively carried on as the
social.” At the close of the reign of Henry VIII. the
church possessed a library of some fifty volumes. Of
these about a dozen were religious plays, part, no
doubt, of the Corpus Christi mystery plays, which were
carried out at St. Dunstan’s with undiminished splendour
till the advent of the new ideas in the reign of
Edward VI.</p>

<p>These parish accounts prove that many cases of
disagreement and misunderstanding, which in modern
times would most likely lead to long and protracted
cases in the Law Courts, were not infrequently settled
by arbitration, or by means of a parish meeting or a
jury of neighbours. Sometimes, undoubtedly, the law
had to be invoked in defence of parochial rights. A
case in point is afforded in the accounts of St. Dunstan’s,
Canterbury. Nicholas Reugge, as we have said
above, had left money to purchase four cows as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
endowment for the Paschal candle and the Font taper.
Things went well, apparently, till 1486, when William
Belser, who rented the stock, died, and his executors
either could not or would not, or, at any rate, did not pay.
To recover the common property, the churchwardens, as
trustees for the parish, had to commence a suit at law.
Chief-Justice Fineux and Mr. Attorney-General John
Roper were two of the parishioners, and the parish
had their advice, it may be presumed gratuitously.
The case, however, seems to have dragged on for
five years, as it was finally settled only in 1491, when
the parish scored a pyrrhic victory, for although they
recovered 30s., the value of three of the cows, their
costs had mounted up to 35s. 2d., and as they never
could get more than a third of that amount from the
defendants, on the whole they were out of pocket by
their adventure with the law.</p>

<p>For the most part, however, the parish settled its
own difficulties in its own way. Documents preserved
almost by chance clearly show that a vast number
of small cases&mdash;police cases we should call them&mdash;were
in pre-Reformation days arranged by the ecclesiastical
authority. Disputes, brawls, libels, minor immoralities,
and the like, which nowadays would have
to be dealt with by the local justices of the peace or
by the magistrates at quarter sessions, or even by the
judges at assizes, were disposed of by the parson and
the parish. It may not have been an ideal system, but
it was patriarchal and expeditious. The Sunday pulpit
was used not only for religious instruction, properly
so called, and for the “bedes-bidding,” but for the publication
of an endless variety of notices of common
interest. The church was, as we have said, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
centre of popular life, and it was under these circumstances
the natural place for the proclamation of
the commencement of some inquiry into a local suit,
or one in which local people were concerned. It was
here, in the house of God, and at the Sunday service
at which all were bound to be present, that witnesses
were cited and accused persons warned of proceedings
against them. Here was made the declaration of the
probate of wills of deceased persons, and warning given
to claimants against the estate to come forward and
substantiate their demands. Here, too, were issued
proclamations against such as did not pay their just
debts or detained the goods of others; here those who
had been guilty of defamation of character were ordered
to restore the good name of those they had calumniated;
and those who, having been joined in wedlock,
had separated without just and approved cause, were
warned of the obligations of Christian marriage. The
transactions of business of this kind in the parish church
by the parish officials made God’s house a practical
reality and God’s law a practical code in the ordinary
affairs of life, and gave religion a living importance
in the daily lives of every member of every parish
throughout the country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">PRE-REFORMATION GUILD LIFE</span></h2>

<p>It would be impossible to fully understand the conditions
of life on the eve of the Reformation without
some knowledge of the working and purposes of
mediæval guilds. These societies or brotherhoods
were so common, formed such a real bond of union
between people of all ranks and conditions of life, and
fulfilled so many useful and even necessary purposes
before their suppression under Edward VI., that a study
of their principles of organisation and of their practical
working cannot but throw considerable light on the
popular social life of the period. To appreciate the
position, it is necessary to bear in mind the very real
hold the Gospel principles of the Christian brotherhood
had over the minds of all in pre-Reformation days, the
extinction of the general sense that man did not stand
alone being distinctly traceable to the tendencies in regard
to social matters evolved during the period of
turmoil initiated by the religious teachings of the Reformers.
What M. Siméon Luce says about the spirit
of common life existing in the villages of Normandy in
the fourteenth century might be adopted as a picture of
English life in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.
“Nobles, priests, religious clerks, sons of the soil who
laboured at various manual works,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> “lived
then, so to say, in common, and they are found continually
together in all their daily occupations. So
far from this community of occupations, this familiar
daily intercourse, being incompatible with the great
inequality of conditions which then existed, in reality
it resulted from it. It was where no strict line of demarcation
divided the various classes that they ordinarily
affected to keep at a distance one from the other.”<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt as to the nature of the
teaching of the English Church in regard to the relation
which, according to true Christian principles,
should exist between all classes of society. In particular
is this seen in all that pertained to the care of
the poorer members of the Christian family. The
evidence appears clear and unmistakable enough in
pre-Reformation popular sermons and instructions, in
formal pronouncements of Bishops and Synods, and in
books intended for the particular teaching of clergy
and laity in the necessary duties of the Christian
man. Whilst fully recognising as a fact that in
the very nature of things there must ever be the
class of those who “have,” and the class of those who
“have not,” our Catholic forefathers in pre-Reformation
days knew no such division and distinction between the
rich man and the poor man as obtained later on, when
pauperism, as distinct from poverty, had come to be recognised
as an inevitable consequence of the new era. To
the Christian moralist, and even to the bulk of Catholic
Englishmen, whether secular or lay, in the fifteenth
century, those who had been blessed by God’s providence
with worldly wealth were regarded not so
much as the fortunate possessors of personal riches,
their own to do with what they listed, and upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
none but they had right or claim, as in the light of
stewards of God’s good gifts to mankind at large,
for the right use and ministration of which they were
accountable to Him who gave them.</p>

<p>Thus, to take one instance: the proceeds of ecclesiastical
benefices were recognised in the Constitutions of
Legates and Archbishops as being in fact as well as in
theory the <i>eleemosynæ et spes pauperum</i>&mdash;the alms and
the hope of the poor. Those ecclesiastics who consumed
the revenues of their cures on other than necessary
and fitting purposes were declared to be “defrauders
of the rights of God’s poor,” and “thieves of Christian
alms intended for them;” whilst the English canonists
and legal professors who glossed these provisions of the
Church law gravely discussed the ways in which the
poor of a parish could vindicate their right to their
share in the ecclesiastical revenues of the Church.</p>

<p>This “<i>jus pauperum</i>,” which is set forth in such a
text-book of English Law as Lyndwood’s <i>Provinciale</i>, is
naturally put forth more clearly and forcibly in a
work intended for popular instruction such as <i>Dives
et Pauper</i>. “To them that have the benefices and
goods of Holy Church,” writes the author, “it belonged
principally to give alms and to have the cure of poor
people.” To him who squanders the alms of the
altar on luxury and useless show, the poor may justly
point and say: “It is ours that you so spend in pomp
and vanity!… That thou keepest for thyself of the
altar passing the honest needful living, it is raveny, it
is theft, it is sacrilege.” From the earliest days of
English Christianity the care of the helpless poor was
regarded as an obligation incumbent on all; and in
1342, Archbishop Stratford, dealing with <i>appropriations</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
or the assignment of ecclesiastical revenues to the support
of some religious house or college, ordered that a
portion of the tithe should always be set apart for the
relief of the poor, because, as Bishop Stubbs has
pointed out, in England, from the days of King
Ethelred, “a third part of the tithe” which belonged
to the Church was the acknowledged birthright of the
poorer members of Christ’s flock.</p>

<p>That there was social inequality is as certain as it was
inevitable, for that is in the very constitution of human
society. But this, as M. Luce has pointed out in regard
to France, and Professor Janssens in regard to Germany,
in no way detracted from the frank and full acknowledgment
of the Christian brotherhood. Again and
again in the sermons of the fifteenth century this truth,
with all its practical applications, was enforced by the
priest at the altar, where both poor and rich alike met
on a common footing&mdash;“all, poor and rich, high and
low, noble and simple, have sprung from a common
stock and are children of a common father, Adam:”
“God did not create a golden Adam from whom the
nobles are descended, nor a silver Adam from whom
have come the rich, and another, a clay Adam, from
whom are the poor; but all, nobles, rich and poor,
have one common father, made out of the dust of the
earth.” These and similar lessons were constantly repeated
by the religious teachers of the pre-Reformation
English Church.</p>

<p>Equally definite is the author of the book of popular
instruction, <i>Dives et Pauper</i>, above referred to. The sympathy
of the writer is with the poor, as indeed is that of
every ecclesiastical writer of the period. In fact, it is
abundantly clear that the Church of England in Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
days, as a <i>pia mater</i>, was ever ready to open wide her
heart to aid and protect the poorer members of Christ’s
mystical body. This is how <i>Pauper</i> in the tract in
question states the true Christian teaching as to the
duties of riches, and impresses upon his readers the
view that the owners of worldly wealth are but stewards
of the Lord: “All that the rich man hath, passing his
honest living after the degree of his dispensation, it is
other men’s, not his, and he shall give full hard reckoning
thereof at the day of doom, when God shall say to
him, ‘Yield account of your bailywick.’ For rich men
and lords in this world are God’s bailiffs and God’s
reeves, to ordain for the poor folk and to sustain them.”
Most strongly does the same writer insist that no
property gives any one the right to say “<i>this is mine</i>”
and that is “<i>thine</i>,” for property, so far as it is of God,
is of the nature of governance and dispensation, by
which those who, by God’s Providence “have,” act
as His stewards and the dispensers of His gifts to such
as “have not.”<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>It would, of course, be affectation to suggest that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
poverty and great hardness of life were not to be found
in pre-Reformation days, but what did not exist was
pauperism, which, as distinguished from poverty, certainly
sprung up plentifully amid the ruins of Catholic
institutions, overthrown as a consequence&mdash;perhaps as
a necessary and useful consequence&mdash;of the religious
changes in the sixteenth century. Bishop Stubbs,
speaking of the condition of the poor in the Middle
Ages, declares that “there is very little evidence
to show that our forefathers in the middle ranks of
life desired to set any impassable boundary between
class and class.… Even the villein, by learning a
craft, might set his foot on the ladder of promotion.
The most certain way to rise was furnished by education,
and by the law of the land, ‘every man or
woman, of what state or condition that he be, shall
be free to set their son or daughter to take learning
at any school that pleaseth him within the realm.’”
Mr. Thorold Rogers, than whom no one has ever
worked so diligently at the economic history of England,
and whom none can suspect of undue admiration
of the Catholic Church, has also left it on record that
during the century and a half which preceded the era
of the Reformation the mass of English labourers were
thriving under their guilds and trade unions, the
peasants were gradually acquiring their lands and
becoming small freeholders, the artisans rising to
the position of small contractors and working with
their own hands at structures which their native genius
and experience had planned. In a word, according to
this high authority, the last years of undivided Catholic
England formed “the golden age” of the Englishman
who was ready and willing to work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the age which I have attempted to describe,”
writes the same authority, “and in describing which
I have accumulated and condensed a vast amount of
unquestionable facts, the rate of production was small,
the conditions of health unsatisfactory, and the duration
of life short. But, on the whole, there were none
of those extremes of poverty and wealth which have
excited the astonishment of philanthropists and are
exciting the indignation of workmen. The age, it is
true, had its discontents, and these discontents were
expressed forcibly and in a startling manner. But of
poverty which perishes unheeded, of a willingness to
do honest work and a lack of opportunity there was
little or none. The essence of life in England during
the days of the Plantagenets and Tudors was that every
one knew his neighbour, and that every one was his
brother’s keeper.”<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the general care of the poorer brethren
of a parish in pre-Reformation England, Bishop Hobhouse,
after a careful examination of the available
sources of information, writes as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> “I can
only suppose that the brotherhood tie was so strongly
realised by the community that the weaker ones were
succoured by the stronger, as out of a family store.
The brotherhood tie was, no doubt, very much stronger
then, when the village community was from generation
to generation so unalloyed by anything foreign, when
all were knit together by one faith and one worship
and close kindred; but, further than this, the guild
fellowships must have enhanced all the other bonds
in drawing men to share their worldly goods as a
common stock. Covertly, if not overtly, the guildsman
bound himself to help his needy brother in sickness and
age, as he expected his fellow-guildsman to do for him
in his turn of need, and these bonds, added to a far
stronger sense of the duty of children towards aged
parents than is now found, did, I conceive, suffice for
the relief of the poor, aided only by the direct almsgiving
which flowed from the parsonage house, or in
favoured localities from the doles or broken meat of a
monastery.”<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>To relieve the Reformation from the odious charge
that it was responsible for the poor-laws, many authors
have declared that not only did poverty largely exist
before, say, the dissolution of the monastic houses, but
that it would not long have been possible for the
ancient methods of relieving the distressed to cope
with the increase in their numbers under the changed
circumstances of the sixteenth century. It is of course
possible to deal with broad assertions only by the production
of a mass of details, which is, under the present
circumstances, out of the question, or by assertions
equally broad, and I remark that there is no evidence
of any change of circumstances, so far as such changes
appear in history, which could not have been fully met
by the application of the old principles, and met in a
way which would never have induced the degree of
distressing pauperism which, in fact, was produced by
the application of the social principles adopted at the
Reformation. The underlying idea of these latter was
property in the sense of absolute ownership in place of
the older and more Christian idea of property in the
sense of stewardship.</p>

<p>Most certainly the result was not calculated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
improve the condition of the poorer members of the
community. It was they who were made to pay,
whilst their betters pocketed the price. The well-to-do
classes, in the process, became richer and more prosperous,
whilst the “masses” became, as an old writer
has it, “mere stark beggars.” As a fact, moreover,
poverty became rampant, as we should have expected,
immediately upon the great confiscations of land and
other property at the dissolution of the religious houses.
To take one example: Dr. Sharpe’s knowledge of the
records of the city of London enables him to say that
“the sudden closing of these institutions caused the
streets to be thronged with the sick and poor.”</p>

<p>“The devil,” exclaims a preacher who lived through
all these troublous times&mdash;“the devil cunningly turneth
things his own way.” “Examples of this we have seen
in our time more than I can have leisure to express or
to rehearse. In the Acts of Parliament that we have
had made in our days what godly preambles hath gone
afore the same; even <i>quasi oraculum Apollinis</i>, as though
the things that follow had come from the counsel of the
highest in heaven; and yet the end hath been either to
destroy abbeys or chauntries or colleges, or such like,
by the which some have gotten much land, and have
been made men of great possessions. But many an
honest poor man hath been undone by it, and an innumerable
multitude hath perished for default and lack
of sustenance. And this misery hath long continued,
and hath not yet (1556) an end. Moreover, all this
commotion and fray was made under pretence of a
common profit and common defence, but in very deed
it was for private and proper lucre.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>In the sixty years that followed the overthrow of
the old system, it was necessary for Parliament to pass
no less than twelve acts dealing with the relief of distress,
the necessity for which, Thorold Rogers says, “can be
traced distinctly back to the crimes of rulers and agents.”
I need not characterise the spirit which is manifested in
these acts, where poverty and crime are treated as indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Dr. Jessop writes: “In the general scramble of the
<i>Terror</i> under Henry the Eighth, and of the <i>anarchy</i> in
the days of Edward the Sixth … the monasteries
were plundered even to their very pots and pans. The
almshouses, in which old men and women were fed and
clothed, were robbed to the last pound, the poor almsfolk
being turned out in the cold at an hour’s warning
to beg their bread. The splendid hospitals for the
sick and needy, sometimes magnificently provided with
nurses and chaplains, whose very <i>raison d’être</i> was that
they were to look after the care of those who were past
caring for themselves, these were stripped of all their
belongings, the inmates sent out to hobble into some
convenient dry ditch to lie down and die in, or to crawl
into some barn or house, there to be tended, not without
fear of consequences, by some kindly man or
woman, who could not bear to see a suffering fellow-creature
drop down and die at their own doorposts.”<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>Intimately connected with the subject of the care of
the poor in pre-Reformation days is obviously that of
the mediæval guilds which, more than anything else,
tended to foster the idea of the Christian brotherhood
up to the eve of the religious changes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>It would probably be a mistake to suppose that
these societies existed everywhere throughout the country
in equal numbers. Mr. Thorold Rogers, it is true,
says&mdash;and the opinion of one who has done so much
work in every kind of local record must carry great
weight&mdash;that “few parishes were probably without
guild lands.” But there is certainly no distinct evidence
that this was the case, especially in counties say
like Hampshire, always sparsely populated as compared
with other districts in the east of England, and where
the people largely depended on agricultural pursuits for
a living. It was in the great centres of trade and manufacture
that the guilds were most numerous and most
important, for it was precisely in those parts that the
advantages of mutual help and co-operation outside the
parish bond were most apparent and combination was
practically possible.</p>

<p>An examination of the existing records leads to a
general division of mediæval guilds into two classes&mdash;<i>Craft</i>
or <i>Trade</i> associations, and <i>Religious</i> or, as some
prefer now to call them, <i>Social</i> guilds. The former,
as their name implies, had, as the special object of their
existence, the protection of some work, trade or handicraft,
and in this for practical purposes we may include
those associations of traders or merchants known under
the name of “guild-merchants.” Such, for instance,
were the great companies of the city of London, and it
was in reality under the plea that they were trading
societies that they were saved in the general destruction
which overtook all similar fraternities and associations
in the sixteenth century. The division of guilds
into the two classes named above is, however, after all
more a matter of convenience than a real distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
founded on fact. All guilds, no matter for what special
purpose they were founded, had the same general characteristic
of brotherly aid and social charity; and no
guild was divorced from the ordinary religious observances
commonly practised by all such bodies in those
days.</p>

<p>It is often supposed that, for the most part, what
are called religious guilds existed for the purpose of
promoting or encouraging the religious practices, such
as the attendance at church on certain days, the taking
part in ecclesiastical processions, the recitations of
offices and prayers, and the like. Without doubt, there
were such societies in pre-Reformation days&mdash;such as,
for example, the great Guild of Corpus Christi, in the
city of York, which counted its members by thousands.
But such associations were the exception, not the rule.
An examination of the existing statutes and regulations
of ancient guilds will show how small a proportion these
purely <i>Ecclesiastical</i> guilds formed of the whole number
of associations known as Religious guilds. The origin of
the mistaken notion is obvious. In mediæval days&mdash;that
is, in times when such guilds flourished&mdash;the word
“religious” had a wider, and what most people who
reflect will be inclined to think, a truer signification
than has obtained in later times. Religion was then
understood to include the exercise of the two commandments
of charity&mdash;the love of God and the love
of one’s neighbour&mdash;and the exercises of practical
charity to which guild brethren were bound by their
guild statutes were considered as much religious practices
as attendance at church or the taking part in an
ecclesiastical procession. In these days, as Mr. Brentano
in his essay <i>On the History and Development of Guilds</i> has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
pointed out, most of the objects, to promote which
the guilds existed, would now be called social duties,
but they were then regarded as true objects of Christian
charity. Mutual assistance, the aid of the poor, of
the helpless, of the sick, of strangers, of pilgrims and
prisoners, the burial of the dead, even the keeping of
schools and schoolmasters, and other such like works
were held to be “exercises of religion.”<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>If the word “religious” be thought now to give a
wrong impression about the nature of associations, the
main object of which was to secure the performance of
duties we should now call “social,” quite as false an
impression would be conveyed by the word “social” as
applied to them. A “social” society would inevitably
suggest to many in these days an association for
convivial meetings, and this false notion of the nature
of a mediæval guild would be further strengthened by
the fact that in many, if not most, of them a yearly, and
sometimes a more frequent feast existed under an item
in their statutes. This guild feast, however, was a mere
incident in the organisation, and in no case did it form
what we might consider the end or purpose of the
association.</p>

<p>By whichever name we call them, and assuming
the religious basis which underlay the whole social
life in the fifteenth century, the character and purpose
of these mediæval guilds cannot in reality be
misunderstood. Broadly speaking, they were the
benefit societies and the provident associations of the
middle ages. They undertook towards their members
the duties now frequently performed by burial clubs,
by hospitals, by almshouses, and by guardians of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
poor. Not infrequently they acted for the public good
of the community in the mending of roads and the
repair of bridges, and for the private good of their
members, in the same way that insurance companies
to-day compensate for loss by fire or accident. The
very reason of their existence was the affording of
mutual aid and assistance in meeting the pecuniary
demands which were constantly arising from burials,
legal exactions, penal fines and all other kinds of payments
and compensations. Mr. Toulmin Smith thus
defines their object: “The early English guild was
an institution of local self-help which, before the poor-laws
were invented, took the place in old times of the
modern friendly or benefit society, but with a higher
aim; while it joined all classes together in the care of
the needy and for objects of common welfare, it did
not neglect the forms and practice of religion, justice,
and morality,”<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> which I may add was, indeed, the
main-spring of their life and action.</p>

<p>“The guild lands,” writes Mr. Thorold Rogers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
“were a very important economical fact in the social
condition of early England. The guilds were the
benefit societies of the time from which impoverished
members could be, and were, aided. It was an age in
which the keeping of accounts was common and
familiar. Beyond question, the treasurers of the village
guild rendered as accurate an annual statement of their
fraternity as a bailiff did to his lord.… It is quite
certain that the town and country guilds obviated
pauperism in the middle ages, assisted in steadying
the price of labour, and formed a permanent centre
for those associations which fulfilled the function that
in more recent times trades unions have striven to
satisfy.”<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>An examination of the various articles of association
contained in the returns made into the Chancery in
1389, and other similar documents, shows how wide
was the field of Christian charity covered by these
“fraternities.” First and foremost amongst these works
of religion must be reckoned the burial of the dead;
regulations as to which are invariably to be found in all
the guild statutes. Then, very generally, provisions for
help to the poor, sick, and aged. In some, assistance
was to be given to those who were overtaken by misfortune,
whose goods had been damaged or destroyed
by fire or flood, or had been diminished by loss or
robbery; in others, money was found as a loan to such
as needed temporary assistance. In the guild at
Ludlow, in Shropshire, for instance, “any good girl
of the guild had a dowry provided for her if her father
was too poor to find one himself.” The “guild-merchant”
of Coventry kept a lodging-house with
thirteen beds, “to lodge poor folk coming through the
land on pilgrimage or other work of charity,” with a
keeper of the house and a woman to wash the pilgrims’
feet. A guild at York found beds and attendance
for poor strangers, and the guild of Holy Cross in
Birmingham kept almshouses for the poor in the
town. In Hampshire, the guild of St. John at Winchester,
which comprised men and women of all sorts
and conditions, supported a hospital for the poor and
infirm of the city.</p>

<p>The very mass of material at hand makes the task
of selecting examples for illustrating some of the objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
for which mediæval guilds existed somewhat difficult.
I take a few such examples at haphazard. The organisation
of these societies was the same as that which has
existed in similar associations up to the time of our
modern trades unions. A meeting was held at which
officers were elected and accounts audited; fines for
non-acceptance of office were frequently imposed, as
well as for absence from the common meeting. Often
members had to declare on oath that they would fulfil
their voluntary obligations, and would keep secret the
affairs of the society. Persons of ill-repute were not
admitted, and members who disgraced the fraternity
were expelled. For example, the first guild statutes
printed by Mr. Toulmin Smith are those of Garlekhithe,
London. They begin: “In worship of God Almighty
our Creator and His Mother Saint Mary, and all Saints,
and St. James the Apostle, a fraternity is begun by good
men in the Church of St. James, at Garlekhith in London,
on the day of Saint James, the year of our Lord
1375, for the amendment of their lives and of their
souls, and to nourish greater love between the brethren
and sisters of the said brotherhood.” Each of them
has sworn on the Book to perform the points underwritten.</p>

<p>“First: all those that are, or shall be, in the said
brotherhood shall be of good life, condition, and
behaviour, and shall love God and Holy Church and
their neighbours, as Holy Church commands.” Then,
after various provisions as to meetings and payments to
be made to the general funds, the statutes order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span> “if
any of the foresaid brethren fall into such distress that
he hath nothing, and cannot, on account of old age or
sickness, help himself, if he has been in the brotherhood
seven years, and during that time has performed all
duties, he shall have every week after from the common
box fourteen pence (<i>i.e.</i> about £1 a week of our money)
for the rest of his life, unless he recovers from his
distress.”<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> In one form or other this provision for the
assistance of needy members is repeated in the statutes
of almost every guild. Some provide for help in case
of distress coming “through any chance, through fire
or water, thieves or sickness, or any other haps.” Some,
besides granting this kind of aid, add: “and if so befall
that he be young enough to work, and he fall into distress,
so that he have nothing of his own to help himself
with, then the brethren shall help him, each with a
portion as he pleases in the way of charity.”<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Others
furnish loans from the common fund to enable brethren
to tide over temporary difficulties: “and if the case
falleth that any of the brotherhood have need to borrow a
certain sum of silver, he (can) go to the keepers of the
box and take what he hath need of, so that the sum be
not so large that any one may not be helped as well as
another, and that he leave a sufficient pledge, or else
find a sufficient security among the brotherhood.”<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
Some, again, make the contributions to poor brethren
a personal obligation on the members, such as a farthing
a week from each of the brotherhood, unless the distress
has been caused by individual folly or waste. Others
extend their Christian charity to relieve distress beyond
the circle of the brotherhood&mdash;that is, of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> “whosoever
falls into distress, poverty, lameness, blindness,
sent by the grace of God to them, even if he be a thief
proven, he shall have seven pence a week from the
brothers and sisters to assist him in his need.”<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Some
of the guilds in seaside districts provide for help in case
of “loss through the sea,” and there is little doubt that
in mediæval days the great work carried on by such a
body as the Royal Lifeboat Society would have been
considered a work of religion, and the fitting object of
a religious guild.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to multiply examples of the
purposes and scope of the old fraternities, and it is
sufficient to repeat that there was hardly any kind of
social service which in some form or other was not
provided for by these voluntary associations. As an
illustration of the working of a trade or craft guild, we
may take that of the “Pinners” of the city of London,
the register of which, dating from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1464, is now in
the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> These are some of the chief
articles approved for the guild by the Mayor and Corporation
of the city of London: (1) No foreigner to be
allowed to keep a shop for the sale of pins. (2) No
foreigner to take to the making of pins without undergoing
previous examinations and receiving the approval
of the guild officers. (3) No master to receive another
master’s workman. (4) If a servant or workman who
has served his master faithfully fall sick he shall be kept
by the craft. (5) Power to the craft to expel those
who do ill and bring discredit upon it. (6) Work at
the craft at nights, on Saturdays, and on the eves of
feasts is strictly prohibited. (7) Sunday closing is
rigidly enforced.</p>

<p>It is curious to find, four hundred years ago, so
many of the principles set down as established, for
which in our days trades unions and similar societies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
are now contending. It has been remarked above, that
even in the case of craft guilds, such as this Society of
Pinners undoubtedly was, many of the ordinary purposes
of the religious guilds were looked to equally
with the more obvious object of protecting the special
trade or handicraft of the specific society. The accounts
of this Pinners’ Guild fully bear out this view. For
example: We have the funeral services for departed
brethren, and the usual <i>trentals</i>, or thirty masses, for
deceased members. Then we find: “4d. to the wax
chandlers’ man for setting up of our lights at St. James.”
One of the members, William Clarke, borrowed 5s. 10d.
from the common chest, to secure which he placed a
gold ring in pledge. There are also numerous payments
for singers at the services held on the feast days
of the guild, and for banners and other hangings for
processions.</p>

<p>Of payments for the specific ends of the guild
there are, of course, plenty of examples. For instance:
spurious pins and “other ware” are searched for and
burnt by the craft officers, and this at such distances
from London as Salisbury and the fair at Stourbridge,
near Cambridge, the great market for East Anglia and
the centre of the Flanders trade. “William Mitchell is
paid 8d. for pins for the sisters, on Saint James’ day.”
In 1466, a man is fined 2s. for setting a child to
work before he had been fully apprenticed; and
also another had to pay 2s. for working after seven
o’clock on a winter night. Later on in the accounts
we have a man mulcted for keeping a shop before he
was a “freeman” of the society, and another “for
that he sold Flaundres pynnes for English pynnes.”
At another time, a large consignment of no less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
12,000 “pynnes of ware” were forfeited to the craft,
and sold by them for 8s., which went to the common
fund. These accounts show also the gradual rise in
importance and prosperity which the Pinners’ Guild,
under the patronage of St. James, manifested. At
first, the warden and brethren at their yearly visit to
Westminster were content to hire an ordinary barge
upon the Thames, but after a few years they had
started “a keverid boote” of their own at the cost of
half-a-crown, in place of the sixpence formerly paid.
So, too, in the early days of their incorporation they
had their annual dinner and audited their accounts at
some London tavern&mdash;the “Mayremayde in Bread
Street” and “the brew house atte the Sygne of the
Rose in Old Jury” are two of the places named. Later
on they met in some hall belonging to another guild,
such as the “Armourers’” Hall, and later still they
built their own Guild Hall and held their banquet there.
This building made a great demand upon their capital,
and the officers evidently began to look more carefully
after the exaction of fines. For late working at this
time one of the brethren was mulcted in the sum of
twenty pence; another was fined twopence for coming
late to the guild mass, and several others had to pay
for neglecting to attend the meeting. From the period
of starting their own hall, ill-fortune seems to have
attended the society. About the year 1499, they got
involved in a great lawsuit with one Thomas Hill, upon
which was expended a large sum of money. A special
whip was made to meet expenses and keep up the
credit of the guild; for what with counsel’s fees, the
writing of bills, and the drawing of pleas, the general
fund was unable to find the necessary munitions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
war to continue the suit. To the credit of the members,
most of them apparently responded generously to this
call, and, in consequence of this unfortunate litigation,
to many subsequent demands which the empty exchequer
necessitated.</p>

<p>There would be no difficulty whatever in multiplying
the foregoing illustrations of the working of these
mediæval societies. The actual account books of
course furnish us with the most accurate knowledge,
even to minute details, and any one of them would
afford ample material.</p>

<p>The funds at the disposal of the guilds were derived
chiefly from voluntary subscriptions, entrance fees, gifts,
and legacies of members. Frequently these societies
became in process of time the trustees of lands and
houses which they either held and administered for the
purposes of the guilds, or for some specific purpose
determined by the will of the original donor. Thus, to
take one or two examples from the account rolls of the
Guild of Tailors in the city of Winchester. In the time
of King Richard II.&mdash;say 1392&mdash;the usual entrance
fee for members was 3s. 4d., and the annual
subscription was 1s. There were 106 members at
that time, seven of whom had been enrolled during
the previous year. Among others who had thus
entered was one Thomas Warener, or Warner, a
cousin of Bishop William of Wykeham, and the
Bishop’s bailiff of the Soke; his payment was 4s. 8d.
instead of the usual entrance fee. In the same year we
find the names of Thomas Hampton, lord of the manor
of Stoke Charity, and Thomas Marleburgh, who was
afterwards Mayor of Winchester. In the following
year, seventeen new members were enrolled, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
them being a baker of Southampton, called Dunster.
Turning over these accounts, we come upon examples
of presents either in kind or money made to the society.
Thus in one place Thomas Marleburgh makes a present
of a hooded garment which was subsequently sold for
eighteen pence; and in another, one Maurice John
Cantelaw presented for the service of the guild, “a
chalice and twelve pence in counted money,” requesting
the members “to pray for his good estate, for the
souls of his parents, friends, benefactors, and others for
whom he was bound to pray.” In return for this
valuable present, the guild granted that it should be
accounted as Cantelaw’s life-subscription.</p>

<p>Having spoken of the sources of income, which
were practically the same in all guilds, something must
be said as to the expenditure over and above the
purposes for which the guilds existed. This may be
illustrated from the accounts of this same fraternity of
tailors of Winchester.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> In the first place, as in almost
every similar society, provision was made for the
funerals of members and for the usual daily mass for
thirty days after the death of the deceased members.
The sum set down is 2s. 6d. for each trental of thirty
masses. Then we find mention of alms to the poor
and sick; thus in 1403, the sum of 36s., about one-tenth
of the annual revenue, was spent upon this object.
This, of course, was charity of a general kind, and
wholly unconnected with the assistance given by rule
to necessitous members of the guild.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>One expense, very common in these mediæval
guilds, was the preparation for taking a fitting part
in the great annual religious pageant or procession
on Corpus Christi day. In the case of this Tailors’
Guild at Winchester, we find sums of money charged
for making wax torches and ornamenting them with
flowers and red and blue wax, with card shields and
parchment streamers, or “pencils,” as they are called.
The members of the guild apparently carried small
tapers; but the four great torches were borne by hired
men, who received a shilling each for their trouble.
It is somewhat difficult for us nowadays to understand
the importance attached to these great ecclesiastical
pageants by our ancestors four hundred years or
so ago. But as to the fact, there can be no doubt.
Among the documents in the municipal archives of
Winchester there exists an order of the Mayor and
Corporation as to the disposition of this solemn procession
in 1435. It runs thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> “At a convocation
holden in the city of Winchester the Friday next after
the Feast of Corpus Christi in the thirteenth year of the
reign of King Harry the Sixth, after the conquest; it
was ordained by Richard Salter, mayor of the city of
Winchester, John Symer and Harry Putt, bailiffs of
the city aforesaid, and also by all the citizens and
commonalty of the same city: It is agreed of a certain
general procession on the Feast of Corpus Christi, of
divers artificers and crafts within the said city: that is
to say the carpenters and felters shall go together first;
smiths and barbers, second; cooks and butchers, third;
shoemakers with two lights, fourth; tanners and japanners,
fifth; plumers and silkmen, sixth; fishers and
farriers, seventh; taverners, eighth; weavers, with two
lights, ninth; fullers, with two lights, tenth; dyers,
with two lights, eleventh; chaundlers and brewers,
twelfth; mercers, with two lights, thirteenth; the wives
with one light and John Blake with another light,
fourteenth; and all these lights shall be borne orderly
before the said procession before the priests of the city.
And the four lights of the brethren of St. John’s shall
be borne about the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
same day in the procession aforesaid.”</p>

<p>The brethren of St. John’s just named, as the chief
object of their association, kept a hospital for the poor
and sick in the city. They paid a chaplain of their
own, as indeed did most of the guilds, and had a
master and matron to look after the comfort of the
poor. They provided bed and bedding, and carefully
administered not only their own subscriptions, but the
sums of money freely bequeathed to them to be spent
on charity. At every market held within the precincts
of Winchester an officer, paid by the society, attended
and claimed for the support of the poor a tax of two
handfuls of corn from every sack exposed for sale.
The mayor and bailiffs were apparently the official
custodians of this guild, and numerous legacies in wills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
even in the reign of Henry VIII., attest its popularity.
For example, on February 19, 1503, John Cornishe,
alias Putte, late Mayor of Winchester, died and left to
the guardians his tenements and gardens under the
penthouse in the city for the charity, on condition that
for ten years they would spend 6s. 8d. in keeping his
annual obit. In 1520, a draper of London, named
Calley, bequeathed ten shillings to the hospital for
annually repairing and improving the bedding of the
poor. The accounts of this Fraternity of St. John’s
Hospital for a considerable period in the fourteenth
century are still in existence. They show large receipts,
sometimes amounting to over £100, from lands,
shops, houses, and from the sale of cattle and farm
produce, over and above the annual subscriptions of
members. On the other side, week by week we have
the payments for food provided for the service of the
poor: fish, flesh, beer, and bread are the chief items.
One year, for instance, the bread bought for the sick
amounted to 36s. 6d.; beer to 36s. 8d.; meat to 32s. 2d.;
fish to 28s. 3½d., &amp;c. Besides this seven shillings were
expended in mustard, and 3s. 6d. for six gallons of
oil. This same year the guardians also paid 2s. 2d. for
the clothes and shoes for a young woman named Sibil
“who nursed the poor in the hospital.” The above represents
only the actual money expended over the sick
patients, and from the same source, most minute and
curious information might be added as to the other expenses
of the house, including, for instance, even the
purchase of grave-clothes and coffins for the dead poor,
the wages and clothing of the matron and servant, and
the payment of the officer who collected the handfuls of
corn in the market-place. At times we have evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of the arrival and care of strange poor people&mdash;we
should perhaps call them “tramps” in our day. For
instance, here is one heading: “The expenses of three
poor strangers in the hospital for 21 days and nights,
15¾d.; to each of whom is given ¾d. <i>Item</i>: the
expenses of one other for 5 days, 3¾d. <i>Item</i>: the expenses
of the burial of the said sick person, 3d. <i>Item</i>:
the expenses of four pilgrims lodged for a night, 2d.
<i>Item</i>: new straw to stuff the beds of the sick, 8d.
<i>Item</i>: paid to the laundress for washing the clothes of
the sick during one year, 12d.”</p>

<p>To speak of guilds without making any mention of
the feasts&mdash;the social meetings&mdash;which are invariably
associated with such societies, would be impossible.
The great banquets of the city companies are proverbial,
and, in origin at least, they arose out of the guild
meeting for the election of officers, followed by the
guild feast. As a rule, these meetings took place on
the day on which the Church celebrated the memory
of the Saint who had been chosen as patron of the
society, and were probably much like the club dinners
which are still cherished features of village life in
many parts of England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>It has been said that the wardens of guilds were
frequently named in mediæval wills as trustees of money
for various charitable purposes. As an example of
property thus left to a guild, take the Candlemas Guild,
established at Bury St. Edmunds: the society was
established in the year 1471, and a few years later one
of the members made over to the brethren considerable
property for the common purposes of the guild and
other specified objects. His name was John Smith, a
merchant of Bury, and he died, we are told, on “St.
Peter’s even at Midsummer, 1481.” His will, which
is witnessed by the Abbot and Prior of St. Edmund’s
Abbey, provides, in the first place, for the keeping of
an obit “devoutly.” The residue of the income was
to accumulate till the appointment of each new abbot,
when, on the election, the entire amount was to be
paid over to the elect in place of the sum of money
the town was bound to pay on every such occasion.
Whatever remained over and above this was to be
devoted to the payments of any tenth, fifteenth, or
other tax, imposed upon the citizens by royal authority.
This revenue was to be administered by the guardians
of the guild, who were bound at the yearly meeting at
Candlemas to render an account of their stewardship.
Year by year John Smith’s will was read out at the
meeting, and proclamation was made before the anniversary
of his death in the following manner:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> “Let us
all of charity pray for the soul of John. We put you
in remembrance that you shall not miss the keeping of
his <i>Dirge</i> and also of his Mass.” Round about the
town the crier was sent to recite the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“We put you in remembrance all that the oath have made,</div>
<div class="verse">To come to the Mass and the <i>Dirge</i> the souls for to glade:</div>
<div class="verse">All the inhabitants of this town are bound to do the same,</div>
<div class="verse">To pray for the souls of John and Anne, else they be to blame:</div>
<div class="verse">The which John afore-rehearsed to this town hath been full kind,</div>
<div class="verse">Three hundred marks for this town hath paid, no penny unpaid behind.</div>
<div class="verse">Now we have informed you of John Smith’s will in writing as it is,</div>
<div class="verse">And for the great gifts that he hath given, God bring his soul to bliss. Amen.”<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The example set by this donor to the Candlemas
Guild at Bury was followed by many others in the
later part of the fifteenth century. For instance, a
“gentlewoman,” as she calls herself, one Margaret
Odom, after providing by will for the usual obit and
for a lamp to burn before “the holie sacrament in St.
James’s Church,” desires that the brethren of the guild
shall devote the residue of the income arising from
certain houses and lands she has conveyed to their
keeping, to paying a priest to “say mass in the chapel
of the gaol before the prisoners there, and giving them
holy water and holy bread on all Sundays, and to give
to the prisoners of the long ward of the said gaol every
week seven faggots of wood from Hallowmass (November
1) to Easter Day.”<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Intimately connected with the subject of the guilds
is that of the fairs, which formed so great a feature in
mediæval commercial life, and at which the craft guilds
were represented. For the south of England, the
great fair held annually at Winchester became the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
centre of our national commerce with France. The
following account of it is given in Mr. W. J. Ashley’s
most interesting <i>Introduction to English Economic History</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
“A fair for three days on the eastern hill outside
Winchester was granted to the bishop by William II.;
his immediate successors granted extension of time,
until by a charter of Henry II. it was fixed at sixteen
days, from 31st August to 15th September. On the
morning of 31st August ‘the justiciars of the pavilion of
the bishop’ proclaimed the fair on the hilltop, then
rode on horseback through the city proclaiming the
opening of the fair. The keys of the city and the
weighing machine in the wool market were taken
possession of, and a special mayor and special bailiffs
were appointed to supersede the city officials during
the fair time. The hilltop was quickly covered with
streets of wooden shops: in one, the merchants from
Flanders; in another, those of Caen or some other
Norman town; in another, the merchants from Bristol.
Here were placed the goldsmiths in a row, and there
the drapers, &amp;c., whilst around the whole was a wooden
palisade with guarded entrance, a precaution which did
not always prevent enterprising adventurers from
escaping payment of the toll by digging a way in for
themselves under the wall.… In Winchester all trade
was compulsorily suspended, and within ‘a seven league
circuit,’ guards being stationed at outlying posts, on
bridges and other places of passage, to see that the
monopoly was not infringed. At Southampton nothing
was to be sold during the fair time but victuals, and even
the very craftsmen of Winchester were bound to transfer
themselves to the hill and there carry on their occupations
during the fair. There was a graduated scale of
tolls and duties: all merchants of London, Winchester,
or Wallingford who entered during the first week were
free from entrance tolls.… In every fair there was a
<i>court of pie-powder</i> (of dusty feet) in which was decided
by merchant law all cases of dispute that might arise,
the ordinary jurisdiction being for a time suspended in
the town; at Winchester this was called the Pavilion
Court. Hither the bishop’s servants brought all the
weights and measures to be tested; here the justices
determined on an assize, or fixed scale, for bread, wine,
beer, and other victuals, adjudging to the pillory any
baker whose bread was found to be of defective weight;
and here every day disputes between merchants as to
debts were decided by juries upon production and
comparison of the notched wooden tallies.”<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>A few words must be said about the final destruction
of the English guilds. At the close of the reign of
Henry VIII. an act of Parliament was passed vesting
the property of colleges, chantries, fraternities, brotherhoods
and guilds in the Crown (38 Hen. VIII., c. 4).
The king was empowered to send out his commissioners
to take possession of all such property, on the plea that
it might be “used and exercised to more godly and
virtuous purposes.” Henry died before the provisions
of the act could be complied with, and a second act
was passed through the first Parliament in the reign of
Edward VI. (1 Ed. VI., c. 14). This went beyond the
former decree of destruction, for after providing for
the demolition of colleges, free chapels, and chantries,
it proceeded not only separately by name to grant to
the king all sums of money devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> “by any manner
of corporations, guilds, fraternities, companies or fellowships
or mysteries or crafts,” to the support of a priest,
obits or lights (which may be taken under colour of
religion), but to hand over to the crown “all fraternities,
brotherhoods and guilds, being within the realm of
England and Wales and other the king’s dominions,
and all manors, lands, tenements, and other hereditaments
belonging to them, other than such corporations,
guilds, fraternities, &amp;c., and the manors, lands, &amp;c.,
pertaining to the said corporations, &amp;c., above
mentioned.”</p>

<p>The Parliament of Henry VIII. assigned as a reason
for this seizure of the property of the corporate bodies
the need “for the maintenance of these present wars,”
and cleverly put into one group “colleges, free chapels,
chantries, hospitals, fraternities, brotherhoods, and
guilds.” “The act of Edward VI.,” writes Mr. Toulmin
Smith, “was still more ingenious, for it held up the
dogma of purgatory to abhorrence, and began to hint
at grammar schools. The object of both acts was the
same. All the possessions of all the guilds (except
what could creep out as being mere trading guilds,
which saved the London guilds) became vested by
these two acts in the Crown; and the unprincipled
courtiers who had advised and helped the scheme
gorged themselves out of this wholesale plunder of
what was, in every sense, public property.”<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>It is clear that in seizing the property of the guilds
the Crown destroyed far more than it gained for itself.
A very large proportion of their revenues was derived
from the entrance fees and the annual subscriptions of
the existing members, and in putting an end to these
societies the State swept away the organisation by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
these voluntary subscriptions were raised, and this
not in one or two places, but all over England. In
this way far more harm was in reality done to the
interests of the poor, sick, and aged, and, indeed, to
the body politic at large, than the mere seizure of
their comparatively little capital, whether in land or
money.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, meant to imply that the injury
to the poor and sick was not fully recognised at the
time of these legal confiscations. People deeply resented
the idea that what generations of benefactors
had intended for the relief of distress should thus be
made to pass into the pocket of some “new” man who
had grown great upon the spoils. The literature of
the period affords abundant evidence of the popular
feeling. Crowley, for instance, wrote about 1550&mdash;just
at this very time&mdash;and although no one would
look for any accurate description of facts in his rhyming
satires, he may be taken as a reliable witness as to what
the people were saying. This is what he writes on the
point:&mdash;</p>

<p>It has frequently been asserted that although grave
injury was undoubtedly done to the poor of the land
by this wholesale confiscation, it was done unwittingly
by the authorities, or that, at the worst, the portions
of revenue derived from the property which had been
intended for the support of the sick, aged, &amp;c., was
so bound up with those to which religious obligations
(now declared superstitious and illegal) were attached,
that it was impossible to distinguish the latter from
the former, and all perished together, or rather passed
undistinguished into the royal pocket. Such a view is
not borne out by facts, and however satisfactory it
might be to believe that this robbery of the poor and
sick by the Crown was accidental and unpremeditated,
the historian is bound by the evidence to hold that the
pillage was fully premeditated and deliberately and consciously
carried out. It is of course obvious, that some
may regard it as proper that funds given for the support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
of priests to say masses or offer prayers for the souls of
the departed should have been confiscated, although it
would have been better had the money been devoted to
some purpose of local utility rather than that it should
have been added to the Crown revenues or have gone
to enrich some royal favourite. For example it may, for
the sake of argument, be admitted that the two fields
at Petersfield in Hampshire thus taken by the royal
commissioners&mdash;one called <i>White field</i>, in the tenure
of Gregory Hill, the rent of which was intended to
keep a perpetual light burning in the parish church,
and the other held by John Mill, given to support a
priest “called the Morrow Masse priest” (<i>i.e.</i> the
priest employed to say the early morning mass for the
convenience of people going to work)&mdash;were under the
circumstances fair articles of plunder for the royal
officials, when the mass was prohibited and the doctrine
symbolised by the perpetual light declared superstitious.
But this will not apply to the money intended for the
poor. It might have been easy to justify the Crown’s
action in taking the priest’s portion, and even the little
pittance intended for the serving clerk, but the seizure
of the benefactions to the poor cannot be defended.
It was not accidental; for an examination of the original
documents relating to the guilds and chantries now in
the Record Office will show not only that the Royal
Commissioners were as a rule careful to distinguish
between the portions intended for religious purposes
and those set aside for perpetual charity to the
sick and poor, but in many cases they actually proposed
to the Court of Augmentation to protect the
latter and preserve them for the objects of Christian
charity intended by the original donors. In every such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
case the document reveals the fact that this suggestion
in the interest of common justice was rejected by the
ultimate Crown officials, and a plain intimation is
afforded on the face of the documents that even those
sums intended by the original donors for the relief of
poverty were to be confiscated.</p>

<p>The destruction of the guilds is, from any point of
view, a sad and humiliating story, and, perhaps fortunately,
history has so far permitted the thick veil of
obscurity drawn over the subject at the time to remain
practically undisturbed. A consideration of the
scope and purposes of English mediæval guilds cannot
but raise our opinion of the wisdom of our forefathers
who fostered their growth, and convince us that many
and useful ends were served by these voluntary societies.
This opinion we can hold, wholly apart from any views
we may entertain about the religious aspects of these
societies generally. Socialistic they were, but their
socialism, so far from being adverse to religion, as the
socialism of to-day is generally considered to be, was
transfused and directed by a deeply religious spirit,
carried out into the duties of life, and manifesting itself
in practical charities of every kind.</p>

<p>One or two points suggested by consideration of
the working of mediæval guilds may be emphasized.
The system of these voluntary societies would be, of
course, altogether impossible and out of place in this
modern world of ours. They would not, and could
not, meet the wants and needs of these days; and yet
their working is quite worth studying by those who are
interested in the social problems which nowadays
are thrusting themselves upon the public notice and
demanding a solution. The general lessons taught by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
these voluntary associations may be summed up under
one or two heads suggested by Mr. Ashley’s volume
already referred to: (1) It is obvious that, unlike what we
find to-day in the commercial enterprises of the world,
capital played but a very small part in the handicrafts
of those times; skill, perseverance, and connection
were more important. (2) The middle ages had no
knowledge of any class of what may be called permanent
wage-labourers. There was no working-class
in our modern sense: if by that is meant a class
the greater portion of which never rises. In the
fourteenth century, a few years of steady work as a
journeyman meant, in most cases, that a workman was
able to set up as a master craftsman. Every hardworking
apprentice expected as a matter of course to
be able to become in time a master. The collisions
between capital and labour to which we are so much
accustomed had no place in the middle ages. (3)
There was no such gulf between master and man as
exists in our days. The master and his journeyman
worked together side by side, in the same shop, at the
same work, and the man could earn fully half as much
as his master. (4) If we desire to institute a comparison
between the status of the working-classes in the
fourteenth century and to-day, the comparison must
be between the workman we know and the old master
craftsman. The shop-keeping class and the middle-man
were only just beginning to exist. The consumer
and producer stood in close relation, and public control
was exercised fully, as the craft guilds were subject
to the supervision and direction of the municipal or
central authority of the cities in which they existed.</p>

<span class="smaller">MEDIÆVAL WILLS, CHANTRIES, AND OBITS</span></h2>

<p>The value of side-lights in an historical picture is frequently
overlooked, or not duly appreciated. The main
facts of a story may be presented with accuracy and
detail, and yet the result may be as unlike the reality
as the fleshless skeleton is to the living man. More
especially are these side-lights requisite when the object
of the inquirer is to ascertain the tone and temper
of minds at some given time, and to discover what men,
under given circumstances, were doing and thinking
about. In trying, therefore, to gauge the mental attitude
of Englishmen towards the ecclesiastical system
existing on the eve of the Reformation, it is important
not to neglect any faint glimmer of light which may
be reflected from the records of the past, the brightness
of which in its setting has been obscured only too well
by the dark storm-clouds of controversy and prejudice.</p>

<p>Not the least valuable among what may be described
as the minor sources of information about the real feeling
of the people generally towards their religion on the
eve of the Reformation are the wills, of which we have
abundant examples in the period in question. It may,
of course, appear to some that their spirit was in great
measure dictated by what they now hold to be the
erroneous opinions then in vogue as to Purgatory and
the efficacy of prayer for the dead. That these doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of the Church had a firm hold on the minds and
hearts of the people at large is certain. The evidence
that this was so is simply overwhelming, and it may be
taken to prove, not merely the existence of the teaching,
but the cordial and unhesitating way in which it
was accepted as a necessary part of the Christian faith.
But this, after all, is merely a minor point of interest in
the wills of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. What
clearly appears in these documents, however, is the
Catholic tone which pervades them, and enables the
reader to realise perhaps more than he is able to do
from any other class of document, the strong hold their
religion must have had on the love and intelligence of
the people of those days. The intelligences may not,
indeed, have been of any very high order, but the souls
were certainly penetrated by true Christian ideals. To
those who penned those early wills, Faith was clearly no
mere intellectual apprehension of speculative truth. Religion,
and religious observance, was to them a practical
reality which entered into their daily lives. The kindly
Spirit that led them, brought them strength to bear
their own and others’ burdens, in sickness and health,
in adversity and prosperity, from childhood till their
eyes closed in their last sleep. If we may judge from
these last aspirations of the Christian soul as displayed
in mediæval wills, we must allow that religion was very
real indeed to our English forefathers in the sixteenth
century, and that in reality the whole social order was
founded upon a true appreciation of the Christian
brotherhood in man, and upon the doctrine of the
efficacy of good works for salvation. These truths of
the social order were not indeed taught perhaps scientifically,
and we might look in vain for any technical expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
of them in the books of religious instruction
most used during this period, but they formed none the
less part of the traditional Christian teaching of the
Middle Ages founded on the great principles of the
Bible which then dominated popular thought.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>Those who would understand what this Christian
spirit meant and the many ways in which it manifested
itself, need only compare the wills of the late fifteenth
and the early sixteenth centuries with those, say, of the
later years of Queen Elizabeth, when the religious revolution
had been accomplished, and note the obvious
difference in tone and purpose. The comparison need
not be searching or entail much study; the change is
patent and striking, and lies on the very surface.</p>

<p>Some examples of notes taken from pre-Reformation
wills may be here given from the collection of Northern
wills published by the Surtees Society under the title
<i>Testamenta Eboracensia</i>, the fourth volume of which contains
many wills made during the period in question.
It may be useful to remark that one and all of these
documents manifest the same spirit of practical Christianity,
though of course in various degrees. Most of
them contain bequests to churches with which the
donors were chiefly connected; money is frequently
left to the fabric, or to some special altar, or for
the purchase of vestments, or to furnish some light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
to burn before the Blessed Sacrament, the rood or
some image, to which the deceased had a particular
devotion. Specific gifts of silks, rich articles of
clothing and embroidered hangings fitted to adorn
the Church of God, to make chasubles and copes,
or altar curtains and frontals, are common. Practical
sympathy with the poor is manifested by provision
for distributions of doles at funerals and at
anniversaries, and by gifts of cloaks and other articles
of clothing, to those of the parish who were engaged in
carrying torches at the burial, or had promised to offer
up prayers for the soul of the testator. Besides these
general features of interest, the wills in question show
us that building operations of great magnitude were
being carried on at this time in the parish churches of
the North, and they thus furnish an additional proof of
the very remarkable interest thus taken by the people
at large in the rebuilding and adornment of the parish
churches of England right up to the very overthrow of
the old ecclesiastical system. These particular wills
also bear a singular testimony to the kindly feelings
which existed at this time between the general body of
the clergy and the regular orders. Nearly every will of
any cleric of note contains bequests of money to monks,
nuns, and friars, whilst, in particular, those of the canons
and officials of the great metropolitan church of York
bear testimony to the affection and esteem in which
they held the Abbot and monks of St. Mary’s Abbey in
the same city, which from its close proximity to the
minster might in these days have been regarded as its
rival.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the religious spirit which pervades
these documents, we may take the following preface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
to the will of one John Dalton of Hull, made in
1487.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> “In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen. I, John Dalton of the Kingstown upon Hull&mdash;considering
and remembering, think in my heart that
the days of man in this mortal life are but short, that
the hour of death is in the hand of Almighty God, and
that He hath ordained the terms that no man may pass.
I remember also that God hath ordained man to die,
and that there is nothing more uncertain than the hour
of death. I seeing princes and (men of) great estates
die daily, and men of all ages end their days, and that
death gives no certain respite to any living creature, but
takes them suddenly. For these considerations, I, being
in my right wit and mind, loved be God, whole not
sick, beseech Almighty God that I may die the true son
of Holy Church and of heart truly confessed, with contrition
and repentance, of all my sins that ever I did
since the first hour I was born of my mother into
this sinful world, to the hour of my death. Of these
offences I ask and beseech Almighty God pardon and
forgiveness; and in this I beseech the Blessed Virgin
Mary and her blessed Son Jesu, our Saviour, that
suffered pain and passion for me and all sinful
creatures, and all the holy company of Paradise to
pray for me.… For these causes aforesaid, I, being
alive of whole mind and memory, loved be God, dispose
and ordain such goods as God hath lent me movable
and immovable by my testament, and ordain this
my last will in the form and manner that followeth:
First, I recommend in humble devotion, contrition, and
true repentance of my faults and sins, praying and
craving mercy of our Saviour Jesus Christ … my
soul to our Lord Jesus Christ when it shall depart from
my body, and to our Lady St. Mary, Saint Michael, St.
John the Baptist, St. John the Evangelist, St. Katherine
and St. Barbara, and to all the whole company and
saints of heaven: and my body I will to the earth
whereof it came.”</p>

<p>The testator then proceeds to direct that his executors
shall give his wife a third of his property, and his
children another third. The rest he wishes to be bestowed
in charity as they may think best “to the
pleasure of God and the health of my soul” … “as
they shall answer before God at the dreadful day of
doom. (Especially) I will them to pay my debts,
charging them before God to discharge me and my
soul; and in this let them do for me as they would I
did for them, as I trust they will do.”<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Of much the same character is the briefer Latin
preface to the will of a sub-dean of York in 1490. “I
protest before God Almighty, the Blessed Mary, and all
saints, and I expressly proclaim that, no matter what
infirmity of mental weakness may happen to me in this
or any other sickness, it is not my intention in anything
to swerve from the Catholic faith. On the contrary
I firmly and faithly believe all the articles of faith,
all the sacraments of the Church; and that the Church
with its sacraments is sufficient for the salvation of any
one however guilty.”<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>To take one more example of the same spirit,
Thomas Dalton, merchant of Hull&mdash;probably son of
the John Dalton whose will is quoted above&mdash;died in
1497. After charging his wife, whom he leaves his
executrix, to pay all his debts, he adds:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span> “And I will
and give my mother forty shillings, beseeching her
meekly to pray for me and to give me her daily blessing,
and that she will forgive me all trespasses and faults
done by me to her since I was born of her, as she will
be forgiven before God at the great day of judgment.”<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Much the same spirit evidently dictated the following
clause in the will of John Sothill of Dewsbury, 1502:
“Also I pray Thomas my son, in my name and for the
love of God, that he never strive with his mother, as he
will have my blessing, for he will find her courteous to
deal with.”<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>Other examples of the catholicity of these mediæval
wills may be here added as they are taken from the
volume almost at haphazard. In 1487, a late mayor
of the city of York leaves money to help in the repairs
of many churches of the city and its neighbourhood.
He charges his executors to provide for the maintenance
of lamps and lights in several places, and specially
names a gold ring with a diamond in it, which he desires
may be hung round the neck of Our Lady’s statue in
York Minster, and another with a turquoise “round our
Lord’s neck that is in the arms of the said image of Our
Lady.” After making provision for several series of
masses to be said, as for example one of thirty in
honour of the Holy Trinity, another in honour of the
Holy Cross, a third in that of Our Lady, &amp;c., the testator
bequeaths a large sum of money to dower fifteen
poor girls, and to find fifty complete sets of beds and
bedding for the poor, as well as other extensive charities.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Wood, a draper of Hull, was sheriff in
1479 and died in 1490. By will he left to his parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
church a piece of worked tapestry, and the clause by
which the bequest was conveyed shows that the church
already possessed many costly hangings of this kind.
It runs thus: “To the Trinity Church one of my best
beds of Arras work, upon condition that after my
decease the said bed shall yearly cover my grave at my
<i>Dirge</i> and Mass, done in the said Trinity Church with
note (in singing) for ever more. Also I will that the
said bed be yearly hung in the said church on the feast
of St. George the Martyr among other worshipful beds,
and when the said bed be taken down and delivered,
then I will that the same bed be re-delivered into the
vestry and there to remain with my cope of gold.”<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>The same kind of gift appears in the last testament
of William Rowkshaw, Rector of Lowthorpe, in 1504.
“I leave,” he says, “to the Church of Catton a bed-covering
worked with great figures to lie in front of
the High Altar on the chief feasts. And I leave also a
bed-covering (worked) with the image of a lion (a blue
lion was the family arms) to place in front of the altar
in the parish church of Lowthorpe on the chief feasts.”
Also in the will of William Graystoke of Wakefield,
executed in 1508, there is made a gift to the parish
church of “a cloth of arras work sometime hanging
in the Hall.”<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>Poor scholars at the universities were not forgotten
in the wills of the period. Mr. Martin Collins, Treasurer
of York, for instance, in 1508 charges his executors to
pay for a scholar at either Oxford or Cambridge for
seven years to study canon law, or the arts. The only
condition is that they are to choose him from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
“poor and very needy, and even from the poorest and
most necessitous.”<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> So, too, William Copley in 1489
leaves money to support two poor priests for the purpose
of study at Cambridge. Archbishop Rotheram in
his long and most Christian will, executed in June 1500,
makes provision for the education of youth. He founds
a college in the place of his birth&mdash;the College of Jesus
at Rotheram&mdash;in thanksgiving for God’s providence in
securing his own education. “For,” he says, “there
came to Rotheram, I don’t know by what chance, but I
believe by the special grace of God, a teacher of grammar,
who taught me and other youths, and by whose
means I and others with me rose in life. Wherefore
desirous of returning thanks to our Saviour, and
to proclaim the reason, and lest I might seem ungrateful
and forgetful of God’s benefits and from whence I
have come, I have determined first of all to establish
there for ever a grammar master to teach all gratuitously.
And because I have seen chantry priests boarding with
lay people, one in one place one in another, to their
own scandal and in some places ruin, I have desired, in
the second place, to make them a common dwelling-house.
For these reasons I have commenced to build
the college of Jesus, where the head shall teach grammar
and the others may board and sleep.” Moreover, as
he has seen, he says, many unlettered and country
folk from the hills (<i>rudi et montam</i>) attracted to church
by the very beauty of ceremonial, he establishes at
Rotheram a choir-master and six singing boys to add
to the attraction of the services, and for such of these
boys, who may not want to become priests, he endows
a master to teach them the art of writing and arithmetic.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>A merchant of Holme, one John Barton, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
leaving legacies to his parish church, charges his
executors to pay the king’s taxes for all people of the
town assessed at 4d. and under, for two years after his
death. John Barton was a merchant of the staple, and
had made his wealth by the wool trade. At Holme
he built “a fair stone house and a fair chapel like a
parish church,” and to remind his descendants of the
source whence their means had come, and in humble
acknowledgment of God’s goodness to him, he set in
the windows of his home the following posie&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">“I thank God, and ever shall,</div>
<div class="verse">It is the sheep hath payed for all.”<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As an example of specific bequests for pious
purposes, we may take the following: Sir Gervase
Clifton in 1491 gives many sums of money to churches
in Yorkshire and to various chantries in Southwell
Minster. For the use of these latter also, he directs
that “all the altar cloths of silk, a bed of gold bawdkyne
and another bed of russet satin, which belonged to
(Archbishop Boothe of York) be delivered to make
vestments.”<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> In 1493-4, John Vavasour, Justice of
the Common Pleas, leaves £100 in money to the
monastery of Ellerton, to which he says he had previously
given all his vestments. He names the Priors
of Ellerton and Thorneholme his executors, and tells
them that the Prior of the Charterhouse of Axholme
has £800 of his in his keeping, and also that a chest of
his plate is in charge of the London Carthusians.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Again Agnes Hildyard of Beverley, in 1497-8,
leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span> “an old gold noble to hang round the neck of
the image of Our Lady in the church of Beverley,” some
money to purchase a mantle for the statue of the
Blessed Virgin at Fisholme, and another gold piece for
the statue at Molescroft.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> About the same time Lady
Scrope of Harling left “to the Rood of Northdor my
heart of gold with a diamond in the midst. To Our
Lady of Walsingham, ten of my great gold beads joined
with silk of crimson and gold, with a button of gold,
tasselled with the same.… To Our Lady of Pew ten
of the same beads; to St. Edmund of Bury ten of the
same; to St. Thomas of Canterbury, ten of the same;
to my Lord Cardinal, ten aves with two <i>Paternosters</i>
of the same beads; to Thomas Fynchman ten aves and
two <i>Paternosters</i> of the same beads.”<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Again, in 1502,
Elizabeth Swinburne bequeathed to the Carmelites of
Newcastle a piece of silver to make a crown for the
image of Our Lady at her altar “where my mother is
buried,” and to Mount Grace a rosary, “fifty beads of
gold, a hundred of corall, with all the gaudys of gold,”
on condition that she and her mother might be considered
<i>consorores</i> of the house, and that thirteen poor
people might be fed on the day of her burial.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> So, too,
a chain of gold is left to make a cup for the Blessed
Sacrament, velvet and silk dresses to make vestments,<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
plate to make a new chrismatory, crystal beads to
adorn the monstrance used on Corpus feast day.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>William Sheffield, Dean of York, whose will is dated
1496, after some few bequests to friends, leaves the
residue to the poor, and he thus explains the reason:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
“Also I will that the residue of my goods be distributed
among the poor parishioners in each of the benefices
I have held, according to the discretion of my
executors, so that they may be bestowed more or less
in proportion to the time of my living and keeping
hospitality in them; for the goods of the church are
the riches of the poor, and so the distribution of church
goods is a serious matter of conscience, and on those
badly disposing of them Jesus have mercy.”<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>The Vicar of Wighill, William Burton, in 1498-9,
left a sum of money to remain in the hands of his
successors for ever “to ease poor folk of the parish, for
to pay their farms with, so that the said people set not
their goods at wainworth (<i>i.e.</i> cartloads&mdash;what they
would fetch), and that they have a reasonable day to
pay the said silver again duly and truly to the Vicar for
the time being, and the said Vicar to ask and keep eyes
(aye) to the same intent, as he will answer for it at the
dreadful day of judgment betwixt God and the devil;
and he shall not lend the foresaid money for any tax or
tallage, nor for any common purpose of the town, but
only to the said poor men.” With kindly thought for
the young among his old flock, the Vicar adds a
bequest of 4d. “to every house poor and rich among
the children.”<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The above is not by any means an isolated instance
of a sum, or sums, of money being left to assist the
poorer members of the Christian brotherhood, represented
by the parish, with temporary loans. One
document sets out the working of such a common
parish chest under the supervision of the priest. The
original chest and the necessary funds for starting this
work of benevolence were furnished by one of the
parishioners. In order to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> “this most pious
object,” as it is called, the rector undertakes to read
out the name of the original donor at the “bedes-bidding”
on principal feasts, together with those of all
who may subsequently add to the capital sum by alms
or legacies, in order that people might be reminded of
their duty to offer up prayers for the eternal welfare of
their benefactors. The chest was to have three locks,
the keys being kept by the rector and the two wardens.
Those who might need to borrow temporarily from the
common stock to meet their rent, purchase of seed or
stock, or for any other purpose, were to bring pledges
to the full value of the loan, or else to find known
sureties for the amount. No single person was to be
surety for more than six shillings and eightpence, and
for wise and obvious reasons the parish priest was not
to be allowed to stand security under any circumstances.
The loan was for a year, and if at the end of that time
the pledge was not redeemed, it was to be sold, but all
that it might fetch over and above the amount of the
original loan was to be returned to the borrower.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>In close connection with the subject of wills in
pre-Reformation times is that of chantries and obits.
Both these two institutions of the later mediæval church
in England have been commonly much misunderstood
and misrepresented. Most writers regard them only
in the light of the doctrine of Purgatory, and as illustrating
the extent to which the necessity of praying for
the dead was impressed upon the people by the ecclesiastical
authorities, and that with a view to their own
profit. It has come, therefore, to be believed that a
“chantry” only meant a place (chapel or other locality)
connected with the parish church, where masses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
offered for the repose of the soul of the donor, and
other specified benefactors. No doubt there were such
chantries existing, but to imagine that all followed this
rule is wholly to mistake the purpose of such foundations.
Speaking broadly, the chantry priests were the
assistant priests or, as we should nowadays say, the
curates of the parish, who were supported by the
foundation funds which benefactors had left or given
for that purpose, and even not infrequently by the
contributions of the inhabitants. To speak the language
of our own time the system held the place of
the “additional curates” or “pastoral aid” societies.
For the most part the <i>raison d’être</i> of these chantry
priests was to look after the poor of the parish, to visit
the sick, and to assist in the functions of the parish
church. By universal custom, and even by statute
law of the English Church, every chaplain and chantry
priest, besides the fulfilment of the functions of his
own special benefice, was bound to be at the disposition
of the parish priest in the common services of
the parish church. His presence was required in the
choir, vested in a surplice or other ecclesiastical dress
proper to his station, or as one of the sacred ministers
of the altar, should his services be so required. In
this way the existence of guild chaplains, chantry
priests, and others, added to the dignity of the ecclesiastical
offices and the splendour of the ceremonial
in most parish churches throughout the country, and
afforded material and often necessary assistance in the
working of the parish.</p>

<p>It will give, perhaps, a better idea of the functions
of a chantry priest on the eve of the Reformation than
can be obtained by any description, to take an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
of the foundation made for a chantry at the altar of
Saint Anne in the church of Badsworth. It was
founded in 1510 to pray for the soul of Isabella, wife
of William Vavasour, and daughter of Robert Urswick.
The charter deed ordains that the chaplain shall be a
secular priest, without other benefice, and that he should
say a Requiem each week with <i>Placebo</i> and <i>Dirige</i>. At
the first lavatory of the Mass he is to turn to the people
and exhort them to pray for the soul of the founder,
saying <i>De Profundis</i> and the prayer <i>Inclina Domine</i>.
Once every year there is to be an anniversary service
on Tuesday in Easter week, when ten shillings and
eightpence is to be distributed to the poor under the
direction of the rector. The chaplain is to be learned
in grammar and plain song, and should be present in
the choir of the parish church at Matins, Mass, Vespers,
and Compline, with other divine services on Sundays
and feasts, when he is to take what part the rector shall
ordain. He is not to be absent for more than a month,
and then only with leave of the rector, by whom, for
certain specified offences, he may be deprived of his
office.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>In these chantries were established services for the
dead commonly called “obits.” These were not, as we
have been asked to believe, mere money payments to the
priest for anniversary services, but were, for the most
part, bequests left quite as much for annual alms to the
poor as for the celebration of those services. A few
examples will illustrate this better than any explanation.
In the town of Nottingham there were two chantries
connected with the parish church of St. Mary, that of
our Lady and that called Amyas Chantry. The former,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
according to the record, was founded “to maintain the
services and to be an aid to the Vicar and partly to
succour the poor;” the latter, to assist in “God’s service,”
and to pray for William Amyas the founder. When the
commissioners, in the first year of Edward VI., came to
inquire into the possession of these chantries, they were
asked to note that in this parish there were “1400
houseling people, and that the vicar there had no other
priests to help but the above two chantry priests.”
They were not, of course, spared on this account, for
within two years the property, upon which these two
priests were supported, had been sold to two speculators
in such parcels of land&mdash;John Howe and John Broxholme.</p>

<p>Then again, in the parish of St. Nicholas, in the
same town, we find from the returns that the members
of the Guild of the Virgin contributed to the support of
a priest. In that parish there were more than 200
houseling people, and as the living was very poor, there
was absolutely no other priest to look after them but
this one, John Chester, who was paid by the guild.
The king’s officials, however, did not hesitate on this
account to confiscate the property. It is needless to
adduce other instances of this kind, some scores of
which might be given in the county of Nottingham
alone. As an example of “obits” and the purposes
for which they were intended, the following instances
may be given, which it must be remembered could be
multiplied to any extent. From the returns of the commissioners
in Nottinghamshire we find that in the parish
of South Wheatley there were parish lands let out to farm
which produced eighteenpence a year, say from eighteen
shillings to a pound of our money. Of this sum, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
shilling was for the poor, and sixpence for church lights;
that is two-thirds, or, say, 16s. of our money, was for the
relief of the distressed. So in the parish of Tuxford, the
church “obit” lands produced £1, 5s. 4d., or about
£16 a year; of which 16s. 4d. was for the poor and
9s. for the church services.</p>

<p>Mr. Thorold Rogers, speaking of the endowments
left by generations of Englishmen for the support of
chantries, obits, &amp;c., says: “The ancient tenements
which are still the property of the London companies
were originally burdened with masses for donors. In
the country, the parochial clergy undertook the services
of these chantries … and the establishment of a mass
or chantry priest at a fixed stipend in a church with
which he had no other relation, was a common form of
endowment. The residue, if any, of the revenue derivable
from these tenements was made the common
property of the guild, and as the continuity of the
service was the great object of its establishment, the
donor, like the modern trustee of a life income, took
care that there should be a surplus from the foundation.
The land or house was let, and the guild consented
to find the ministration which formed the motive of the
grant.”<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>This is very true, but it is questionable whether Mr.
Thorold Rogers appreciated the extent to which these
chantry funds were intended to be devoted to purposes
other than the performance of the specified religious
services. A couple of examples have been given in
Nottinghamshire, and to these may be added one in
the south of England. In connection with the parish
church of Alton, in Hampshire, there were, on the eve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
of the Reformation, six foundations for obits. The following
is the account of these taken from the chantry
certificates made by the king’s commissioners in the
first year of the reign of Edward VI.: (1) “Issues of
land for an obit for John Pigott, growing and coming
out of certain houses and lands in Alton for to maintain
for ever a yearly obit there, in the tenure of Thomas
Mathew, of the yearly value of 23s. 4d.; whereof to the
poor 15s. 4d., to the parish priest and his clerk 8s. (2)
The same for an obit for William Reding, of the annual
value of 15s., of which the poor were to have 10s. and
the priest and his clerk 5s. (3) The same for Alice
Hacker, of the yearly value of 10s., of which the poor
were to get 7s. 8d. and the priest 2s. 4d. (4) Another
of the value of 4s., the poor to get 2s. 10d. and the priest
1s. 2d. (5) Another for the soul of Nicholas Bailey,
worth annually 11s., and of this 7s. 8d. was intended
for the poor and 3s. 4d. for the clergy. (6) Another
for Nicholas Crushelon, worth annually 4s. 4d., the poor
to have 3s. 1d. and the priest 1s. 3d.” In this parish
of Alton, therefore, these six foundations for “obits” or
anniversaries produced a total of 77s. 8d., but so far
from the whole sum being spent upon priests’ stipends,
lights, and singing men, we find that considerably more
than half, namely 46s. 7d., was bestowed upon the relief
of the poor of the parish. Or if we take the value of
money in those days as only twelve times that of our
present money, out of a total of £36, 12s. some £27, 19s.
went to the support of the poor.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the general advantages derived by
a parish from the foundation of these chantries and
obits have been commonly overlooked, and the notion
that they were intended for no other purpose than procuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
prayers for the dead, and that in fact they served
no other end, is altogether misleading and erroneous.
Without the assistance of the clergy, so supported by
the generosity of those who left money for these foundations,
the religious services in many of the parish
churches of England in pre-Reformation times could
not have been so fittingly or even adequately provided
for. Wherever information is available this view is
borne out, and it is altogether to mistake the true bearing
of facts to suppose that in suppressing the chantries
and appropriating the endowment of obits the officials of
Edward VI. merely put an end to superstitious prayers
for the souls in Purgatory. In reality they deprived
the poor of much property left by deceased persons for
their relief, and took away from every parish in England
the assistance of the unbeneficed clergy who had hitherto
helped to support the dignity of God’s worship and look
after the souls of the people in the larger districts.</p>

<p>One instance may be given to illustrate how far the
chantry clergy actually took part in the work of the
parish. At Henley on Thames, on the eve of the
Reformation, there were seven chapels or chantries&mdash;namely,
those of Our Lady, St. Katherine, St. Clement,
St. Nicholas, St. Ann, St. John, and St. Leonard. These
were all supported by various bequests, and the four
priests who served them all resided in a common house
situated in the churchyard known as “the chapel-house,”
or “the four priest chambers.” The disposition of the
services of these chaplains was apparently in the hands
of the “Warden and the commonalty” of the township,
and for the convenience of the people they arrange, for
example, that the chaplain of the Lady altar shall say
his mass there every day at six in the morning, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the priest in charge of St. Katherine’s shall always begin
his at eight.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>“To maintain God’s service” is perhaps the most
common reason assigned to King Edward’s commission
for the existence of a chantry, or chantries, in connection
with a parish church. Thus at Edwinstowe, in
Nottinghamshire, there was a chantry chapel a mile
from the parish church known as Clipston Chantry.
The priest was John Thompson, and he had £5 a year,
and “hath no mansion but a parlour under the chapel.”<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
At Harworth in the same county there was the hospital
of St. Mary’s of Bawtree, founded by Robert Morton to
serve the people two miles from the parish church.
The priest had a mansion and close, “and had to say
Mass every morning before sunrise, for such as be
travellers by the way and to maintain God’s service
there, which towne is also a thoroughfare towne.”<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> At
Hayton, still in the same county, also two miles from
the parish church, was the chantry of Tilne, founded
for a priest to serve the villages of North and South
Tilne “to celebrate mass and minister the sacraments
to the inhabitants adjoining, for that they for the greatness
of the waters cannot divers times in the year repair
to the parish church.” For “the water doth abound
so much within the said hamlets that the inhabitants
thereof can by no means resort into their parish church
of Hayton, being two miles distant from the said chapel,
neither for christening, burying, nor other rights.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The purposes which these chantry priests were
intended to serve is seen to be the same all over England.
To take Suffolk for example: at Redgrave, near
Eye, or rather at Botesdale, a hamlet about a mile and
a half from Redgrave, there was a chapel of “ancient
standing for the ease of the inhabitants of the said street,
which was first built at their cost, whereunto do belong
no other than the chapel yard.” The “street” consisted
of forty-six householders, and by estimation
a hundred and sixty houselings. It was “a common
thoroughfare and hath a liberty of market.” These
matters “the poor inhabitants” submitted to the King;
it is unnecessary to say without success.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> At Levenham
the alderman of St. Peter’s Guild held certain
lands to find a priest who was to teach the children of
the town, and was to be “secondary to the curate, who
without help of another priest is not able to serve the
cure there,” as there were two thousand souls in the
district.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> So, too, at Mildenhall there was a chantry
established, as the parish was long and populous, “having
a great number of houseling people and sundry
hamlets, divers of them having chapels distant from the
parish church one mile or two miles, where the said
priest did sing Mass sundry festival days and other holy
days, and also help the curate to minister the Sacraments,
who without help were not able to discharge his cure.”<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
At Southwold were four cottages left by one John Perce
for an “obit.” The property produced twenty shillings
a year, and of this sum ten shillings were to be distributed
to the poor; eight shillings to maintain the town
and pay the taxes of the poor, and two shillings to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
paid to the parson and his clerk for their services in
church. There was also in the same town a tenement
called Skilman’s, intended to supply a stipendiary priest
for sixteen years to the parish, and after that to go to
the town. The sixteen years were up when the royal
commissioners visited the town, and the whole sum was
then being spent on the town. In vain the people
pleaded that “it was to be considered that the said
town of Southwold is a very poor town, whereupon the
sea lies beating daily, to the great ruin and destruction
of the said town, if that the power and violence of the
same were not broken by the maintenance of jetties
and piers there, and that the maintenance of the haven
and bridge of the same town is likewise very chargeable.”
The marsh belonging to the said tenement, called Skilman’s,
is let to the poor inhabitants of the same town,
every man paying for his cowgate by the year 20d. only
“to the great relief of the poor.”<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>So, too, the Aldermen of the Guild of the Holy
Ghost in Beccles held lands to supply a priest to assist
in the parish for ninety-nine years, to find money to
pay the tenths, fifteenths, and other taxes, and for
other charitable purposes. The property brought in
£10, 9s. 4d., and each year the poor received forty
shillings; thirty shillings went to pay for the taxes,
and the rest&mdash;some £6&mdash;to the priest. In order to
induce the king to leave this fund untouched, the commissioners
of 1547 are asked to note “that Beccles is
a great and populous town,” there being eight hundred
houselings, “and the said priest is aiding unto the
curate there, who without help is not able to discharge
the said cure.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The case of Bury St. Edmunds is particularly
distressing. Amongst other charities, lands had been
left by will or given by various benefactors to find
priests to serve St. Mary’s, to sing “the Jesus Mass,”
and to act as chaplain at the Lady altar. Property also
was given in charge of St. Nicholas Guild of the annual
value of 25s. 4d., of which sum 22s. was to be distributed
to the poor of the town, and the rest was to go to the
annual anniversary services for members of the guild.
More property, too, had been left by one Margaret
Oldham for a priest to say Mass in the church of St.
James on the week days, and in the jail on the Sundays,
and to find the poor prisoners in wood for a fire during
winter months. There were several other similar benefactions
of the same kind, and the parishioners of St.
James’s church “gathered weekly of their devotion”
the stipend of a priest paid to say “the morrow Mass”&mdash;that
is, the Mass at daybreak intended for those who
had to go early to their daily work. When the royal
commissioners came on behalf of the said Edward VI.
to gather in these spoils at Bury, they were asked
to forward to the authorities in London the following
plea for pity: “It is to be considered that the said
town of Bury is a great and populous town, having in
it two parish churches, and in the parishes of the same
above the number of 3000 houseling persons, and a
great number of youth. And the king’s majesty hath
all the tithes and all the profits yearly coming and
growing within the same parishes,<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> finding two parish
priests there. And the said two parish priests are not
able to serve and discharge the said cures without aid
and help of other priests. And further, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
school, nor other like foundation, within the said town,
nor within twenty miles of it, for the virtuous education
and bringing up of youth, nor any hospital or other
like foundation for the comfort and relief of the poor,
of which there is an exceeding great number within the
said town other than what are before mentioned, of
which the said incumbents do now take the whole<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
yearly revenues and profits, and distribute no part
thereof to the aid and comfort or relief of the said
poor people.</p>

<p>“In consideration whereof it may please the king’s
majesty of his most charitable benignity, moved with
pity in that behalf, to convert the revenues and profits
of the sum of the said promotions into some godly
foundation, whereby the said poor inhabitants, daily
there multiplying, may be relieved, and the youth instructed
and brought up virtuously, or otherwise, according
to his most godly and discreet wisdom, and the
inhabitants shall daily pray to God for the prosperous
preservation of his most excellent majesty, long to
endure.”<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the petition had
no effect. At Bury, as indeed all over England, the
claims of the sick and poor were disregarded and the
money passed into the possession of the crown. The
hospitals that mediæval charity had erected and supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
were destroyed; the youth remained untaught;
the poor were deprived of the charity which had
been, as it was supposed, secured to them for ever by
the wills of generations of Catholic benefactors; the
poor prisoners in the jail at Bury had to go without
their Sunday Mass and their winter fire; whilst the
money that had hitherto supported chaplains and
chantry priests to assist the parish priests in the care
of their districts was taken by the crown.</p>

<p>For Yorkshire the certificates of the commissioners
have been published by the Surtees Society. The
same impression as to the utility and purpose of the
chantry and other assisting priests may be gathered
from almost every page. For example, the chantry
of St. Katherine in the parish church of Selby:
“The necessity thereof is to do divine service, and
help the parish priest in time of necessity to minister
sacraments and sacramentals and other divine services.”…
For “the said parish of Selby is a great
parish, having but one curate, and in the same parish
is a thousand houseling people; and the said curate has
no help in time of necessity but only the said chauntry
priest.”<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Again: “Two chantries of our Lady in the parish
church of Leeds, ‘founded by the parishioners there to
serve in the choir and to minister sacraments and other
divine service, as shall be appointed by the vicar and
other honest parishioners there, which they do.…
The necessity thereof is to do divine service, to help the
curate, and minister the Sacraments, having 3000
houseling people.’”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>In the same parish church, the chantry of St. Mary
Magdalene was “founded by William Evers, late vicar
of Leeds, to pray for the soul of the founder and all
Christian souls, to minister at the altar of St. Mary
Magdalene, to keep one yearly obit, with seven shillings
to be distributed, and to serve in the choir at divine
service all holy days and festival days, as appears by
the foundation deed thereof, dated <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1524.”<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>One more example may be taken out of the hundreds
in these volumes: “The chantry, or donative, within
the chapel of Holbecke in the parish of Leeds, ‘the
incumbent is used to say daily mass there and is taken
for a stipendiary priest paying tithes. And there is a
great river between the said parish church and the
chapel, whereby they can by no means often pass to
the said church.… The said chantry is distant from
the said parish church one mile. The necessity thereof
is to do divine service according to the foundation.’”<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>A few words enforcing the lesson to be learned
from these extracts taken from the preface to the second
part of these interesting Yorkshire records may be here
given. Mr. Page, the editor, says: “Up to the time of
the Reformation nearly all education was maintained
by the church, and when the chantries were dissolved
practically the whole of the secondary education of the
country would have been swept away, had not some
provision for the instruction of the middle and lower
classes been made by continuing, under new ordinances,
some of the educational endowments which pious
founders had previously provided.”<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>
<p>“The next most important class of foundations,
some of which were continued under the commission
… consisted of the chapels of ease, which were much
required in extensive parishes with a scattered population,
and had been generally founded by the parishioners
for their own convenience. It seems, therefore, that
the dissolution of these chapels was a peculiar hardship.
As early as 1233, the Pope granted licence to the archbishop
of York to build oratories or chapels and to
appoint to them priests, in places so distant from the
parish churches that the people could with difficulty
attend divine service, and the sick died before the priest
could get to them to administer the last sacraments.
The necessity for these chapels of ease was especially
felt in Yorkshire, where the inhabitants of so many
outlying hamlets were cut off from their parish churches
in winter time by impassable roads and flooded rivers,
which is the reason time after time assigned by the commissioners,
for the necessity of the existence of such
chapels; and yet comparatively few of them were recommended
for continuance by Sir Walter Mildmay and
Robert Kelway in the returns to the commission.
Possibly, it was the loss of the endowments of Ayton
chapel which occasioned the insurrection at Leamer
… which chapel the inhabitants so piously kept up
afterwards at their own expense.”<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>“In most cases, the chantry priest seems to have
acted in much the same capacity in a parish as that
now occupied by the curate; he assisted the parish
priest in performing mass, hearing confessions and
visiting the sick, and also helped in the ordinary
services of the church; the few only were licensed to
preach, like the schoolmaster at Giggleswick. In the
Cathedral Church at York, besides praying for the soul
of his founder and all Christian souls, each chantry
priest had to be present in the choir in his habit of a
parson on all principal and double feast days, Sundays,
and nine lections, at Matins, Mass, Evensong, and processions,
when he had to read lessons, begin anthems,
and to minister at the high altar as should be appointed
to him by the officers of the choir. Besides these
purely ecclesiastical duties, very many of the chantry
priests were bound to teach a certain number of the
children of the neighbourhood, which was the origin of
most of our Grammar schools.”<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">PILGRIMAGES AND RELICS</span></h2>

<p>Pilgrimages and the honour shown to relics are
frequently pointed out as, with Indulgences, among
the most objectionable features of the pre-Reformation
ecclesiastical system. It is assumed that on the eve of
the religious changes the abuses in these matters were
so patent, that no voice was, or indeed could have been,
raised in their defence, and it is asserted that they were
swept away without regret or protest as one of the most
obvious and necessary items in the general purification
of the mediæval church initiated in the reign of Henry
VIII. That they had indeed been tolerated at all even
up to the time of their final overthrow was in part, if
not entirely, due to the clergy, and in particular to the
monks who, as they derived much pecuniary benefit
from encouraging such practices, did not scruple to
inculcate by every means in their power the spiritual
advantages to be derived from them. That the objectionable
features of these so-called works of piety had
long been recognised, is taken for granted, and the
examinations of people suspected of entertaining Wycliffite
opinions are pointed to as proof that earnest men
were alive to these abuses for more than a century
before religion was purified from them. As conclusive
evidence of this, the names, too, of Chaucer for early
times, and of Erasmus for the Reform period, are given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
as those whose condemnation and even scornful rejection
of such practices cannot be doubted. It becomes
important, then, for a right understanding of the mental
attitude of the people generally to the existing ecclesiastical
system at the time of its overthrow, to see how
far the outcry against pilgrimages and the devotion to
relics was really popular, and what were the precise
objections taken to them by the innovators.</p>

<p>It is difficult to exaggerate the importance attached
to pilgrimages by our pre-Reformation forefathers.
From very early times the practice was followed
with eagerness, not to say with devotion, and included
not merely visits to the shrines situated within
the country itself, but long and often perilous journeys
into foreign lands&mdash;to Compostella, Rome, and to the
Holy Land itself. These foreign pilgrimages of course
could be undertaken only by the rich, or by those for
whom the requisite money was found by some one
unable to undertake the journey in person. Not infrequently
the early English wills contain injunctions
upon the executors to defray the cost of some poor
pilgrim to Spain, to Rome, or to some of the noted
shrines on the Continent. The English love for these
works of piety in nowise showed any sign of decadence
even right up to the period of change. Books furnishing
intending pilgrims with necessary information,
and vocabularies, even in Greek, were prepared to assist
them in their voyages. The itineraries of William
Wey, printed by the Roxburghe Club, give a very
good idea of what these great religious pilgrimages must
have been like at the close of the fifteenth century. In
1462 Wey was in the Holy Land, and describes how
joyfully the pilgrims on landing at Jaffa sang the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
“<i>Urbs beata Jerusalem</i> in faburthyn.” In 1456 he
took part in a large English pilgrimage to St. James
of Compostella, leaving Plymouth with a shipload of
English fellow-pilgrims on May 17. William Wey’s
ship was named the <i>Mary White</i>, and in company with
them six other English ships brought pilgrims from
Portsmouth, Bristol, Weymouth, Lymington, and a
second from Plymouth. They reached Corunna on
May 21st, and Compostella for the great celebration of
Trinity Day. Wey was evidently much honoured by
being pointed out to the church officials as the chief
Englishman of note present, and he was given the post
of first bearer of the canopy in the procession of the
Blessed Sacrament. Four out of the six poles were
carried by his countrymen, whom he names as Austill,
Gale, and Fulford.</p>

<p>On their return the pilgrims spent three days at
Corunna. They were not allowed to be idle, but religious
festivities must have occupied most of their time.
On Wednesday, the eve of Corpus Christi day, there
was a procession of English pilgrims throughout the
city and a mass in honour of the Blessed Virgin. On
Corpus Christi itself their procession was in the Franciscan
church, and a sermon was preached in English
by an English Bachelor in Theology on the theme, <i>Ecce
ego; vocasti me</i>. “No other nation,” says William Wey,
somewhat proudly, “had these special services but the
English.” In the first port there were ships belonging
to English, Welsh, Irish, Norman, French, and Breton,
and the English alone had two and thirty.</p>

<p>Such journeys were not, of course, in those days
devoid of danger, especially from sickness brought on,
or developed in the course of the travels. Erasmus, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
his <i>Colloquy on Rash Vows</i>, speaks of losing three in a
company. “One dying on the way commissioned us
to salute Peter (in Rome) and James (at Compostella)
in his name. Another we lost at Rome, and he desired
that we should greet his wife and children for him.
The third we left behind at Florence, his recovery
entirely despaired of, and I imagine he is now in
heaven.” That this account of the mortality among
pilgrims is not exaggerated is shown in the diary of Sir
Richard Torkington, Rector of Mulbarton, in Norfolk.
In 1517 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and records
on “the 25th of August, that was Saynt Bertolmew’s
day, deceased Robert Crosse of London, and was
buried in the churchyard of Salyus (in the island of
Cyprus); and the 27th day of August deceased Sir
Thomas Tappe, a priest of the West country, and was
cast over the board; as were many more whose souls
God assoyl; and then there remained in the ship four
English priests more.”<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>If Englishmen went abroad to the celebrated
shrines, foreigners in turn found their way to the
no less renowned places of pilgrimage in England.
Pilgrims’ inns and places of rest were scattered over
the great roads leading to Glastonbury, Walsingham,
and Canterbury, and other “holy spots” in this island,
and at times these places were thronged with those who
came to pay their devotion. At one time we are told
that more than a hundred thousand pilgrims were together
in the city of Canterbury to celebrate one of the
Jubilee celebrations of the martyr St. Thomas; whilst
the road to Walsingham was so much frequented, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
in the common mind the very “milk way” had been
set by Providence in the heaven to point the path to
Our Lady’s shrine.</p>

<p>With the very question of pilgrimages, Sir Thomas
More actually deals in the first portion of his <i>Dyalogue</i>,
and it would be difficult to find any authority who
should carry greater weight. He first deals with the
outcry raised by the followers of Luther against the
riches which had been lavished upon the churches, and
in particular upon the shrines containing the relics of
saints.</p>

<p>Those who so loudly condemn this devotion shown
by the church to the saints should know, he says “that
the church worships not the saints as God, but as God’s
servants, and therefore the honour that is done to them
redoundeth principally to the honour of their Master;
just as by common custom of people we sometimes, for
their master’s sake, reverence and make great cheer for
people to whom perhaps except for this we would not
have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span> ‘good morrow.’</p>

<p>“And sure if any benefit or alms, done to one of
Christ’s poor folk for his sake, be reputed and accepted
by His high goodness, as done unto Himself: and if
whosoever receiveth one of His apostles or disciples receives
Himself, every wise man may well think that
in like manner he who honours His holy saints for His
sake, honours Himself, except these heretics think that
God were as envious as they are themselves, and that
He would be wroth to have any honour done to any
other, though it thereby redoundeth unto Himself. In
this matter our Saviour Christ clearly declares the contrary,
for He shows Himself so well content that His
holy saints shall be partakers of His honour that He
promises His apostles that at the dreadful doom (when
He shall come in His high majesty) they shall have
their honourable seats and sit with Himself upon the
judgment of the world. Christ also promised that Saint
Mary Magdalene should be worshipped through the
world and have here an honourable remembrance
because she bestowed that precious ointment upon
His holy head. When I consider this thing it
makes me marvel at the madness of these heretics
that bark against the old ancient customs of Christ’s
church, mocking at the setting up of candles, and with
foolish facetiousness (fallacies) and blasphemous mockery
demand whether God and His saints lack light, or
whether it be night with them that they cannot see
without a candle. They might as well ask what good
did that ointment do to Christ’s head? But the heretics
grudge the cost now as their brother Judas did then,
and say it were better spent on alms upon a poor folk,
and thus say many of them who can neither find in
their heart to spend on the one nor the other. And
some spend sometimes on the one for no other intent,
but the more boldly to rebuke against and rail against
the other.”</p>

<p>After pointing out how riches were lavished on the
temple by God’s special ordinance, Sir Thomas More
continues:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span> “If men will say that the money were better
spent among poor folk by whom He (<i>i.e.</i> God) setteth
more store as the living temples of the Holy Ghost
made by His own hand than by the temples of stone
made by the hand of men, this would perhaps be
true if there were so little to do it with that we should
be driven by necessity to leave the one undone. But
God gives enough for both, and gives divers men divers
kinds of devotion, and all to His pleasure. Luther, in a
sermon of his, wished that he had in his hand all the
pieces of the holy cross, and said if he had he would
throw them where the sun should never shine on them.
And for what worshipful reason would the wretch do
such villainy to the cross of Christ? Because, as he
says, there is so much gold now bestowed on the garnishing
of the pieces of the cross that there is none left
for poor folks. Is not this a high reason? As though
all the gold that is now bestowed about the pieces of
the holy cross would not have failed to be given to poor
men if they had not been bestowed on the garnishing
of the cross; and as though there was nothing lost
except what is bestowed about Christ’s cross. Take
all the gold that is spent about all the pieces of Christ’s
cross through Christendom (albeit many a good Christian
prince and other godly people have honourably garnished
many pieces of it), yet if all the gold were gathered
together it would appear a poor portion in comparison
with the gold that is bestowed upon cups&mdash;what do we
speak of cups for? in which the gold, though it is not
given to poor men, is saved, and may be given in alms
when men will, which they never will; how small a
portion, ween we, were the gold about all the pieces of
Christ’s cross, if it were compared with the gold that is
quite cast away about the gilding of knives, swords, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Our author then goes on to put in the mouth of the
“objector” the chief reasons those who were then the
advocates of the religious changes were urging against
pilgrimages to the shrines of saints and to special places
of devotion to our Blessed Lady. Protesting that he
had, of course, no desire to see the images of the saints
treated in any way disrespectfully, the objector declares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
that “yet to go in pilgrimages to them, or to pray to
them, not only seemed vain, considering that (if they
can do anything) they can do no more for us among
them all than Christ can Himself alone who can do all
things, nor are they so ready to hear (if they hear us
at all) as Christ that is everywhere.”… Moreover, to
go a pilgrimage to one place rather than to another
“seems to smell of idolatry,” as implying that God was
not so powerful in one place as He is in another, and,
as it were, making God and His saints “bound to a
post, and that post cut out and carved into images.
For when we reckon we are better heard by our Lord
in Kent than at Cambridge, at the north door of Paul’s
than at the south door, at one image of our Lady than
at another,” is it not made plain that we “put our trust
and confidence in the image itself, and not in God and
our Lady,” and think of the image and not of what the
image represents.</p>

<p>Further, “men reckon that the clergy gladly favour
these ways, and nourish this superstition under the name
and colour of devotion, to the peril of people’s souls for
the lucre and temporal advantage that they themselves
receive from the offerings” (p. 120).</p>

<p>Lest it may be thought that these objections to
places of pilgrimage were merely such as Sir Thomas
More invented to put into the mouth of the “objector”
in order to refute them, the reader may like to have the
words of a known advocate of the new ideas. Lancelot
Ridley, in his expositions of some of the Epistles,
states his views very clearly. “Ignorant people,” he
writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span> “have preferred the saints before God, and put
more trust, more confidence, (look for) more help and
succour, in a saint than in God. Yea, I fear me that
many have put their help and succour in an image made
of stone or of wood by men’s hand, and have done
great honour and reverence to the image, believing
that great virtue and great holiness was in that image
above other images. Therefore that image must have
a velvet coat hanged all over with brooches of silver,
and much silver hanged about it and on it, with much
light burning before it, and with candles always burning
before it. I would no man (should put out the light)
in contempt of the saint whose image there is, but I
would have this evil opinion out of the simple hearts
that they should esteem images after the value they are,
and put no more holiness in one image than in another,
no more virtue in one than in another. It holds the
simple people in great blindness, and makes them put
great trust and (esteem) great holiness in images, because
one image is called our Lady of Grace, another our
Lady of Pity, another our Lady of Succour or Comfort;
the Holy Rood of such a place, &amp;c.” And this he maintained,
though he did not condemn images generally
in churches. These he thought useful to remind people
of God’s saints and their virtues, and “to stir up our
dull hearts and slothful minds to God and to goodness.”
What he objected to chiefly was the special places of
pilgrimage and special images to which more than
ordinary devotion was shown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>In another of his <i>Expositions</i>, printed in 1540, Ridley
again states his objections to the places of pilgrimage.
“Some think,” he writes, “that they have some things
of God, and other part of saints, of images, and so
divide God’s glory, part to God and part to an image,
of wood or of stone made by man’s hand. This some
ignorant persons have done in times past, and thanked
God for their health and the blessed Lady of Walsingham,
of Ipswich, St. Edmund of Bury, Etheldred of
Ely, the Lady of Redbourne, the Holy Blood of Hayles,
the Holy Rood of Boxley, of Chester, &amp;c., and so other
images in this realm to the which have been much
pilgrimage and much idolatry, supposing the dead
images could have healed them or could have done
something for them to God. For this the ignorant
have crouched, kneeled, kissed, bobbed and licked the
images, giving them coats of cloth, of gold, silver, and
of tissue, velvet, damask, and satin, and suffered the
living members of Christ to be without a russet coat
or a sackcloth to keep them from the cold.”<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>Again in another place he says that his great
objection to images is not that they may not be
good in themselves and as a reminder of the holiness
of the saints, but that they are used as a means of
making money. “Who can tell,” he writes, “half the
ways they have found to get, yea to extort money from
men by images, by pardons, by pilgrimages, by indulgences,
&amp;c. … all invented for money.” The above
passages may be taken as fair samples of the outcry
against shrines and pilgrimages raised by the English
followers of Luther and the advocates of the religious
changes generally. It will be noticed that the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of the objections was in reality only the same as that
which induced them to declare against any honour
shown to images, whether of Christ or His saints.
There is no suggestion of any special abuses connected
with particular shrines and places of pilgrimage, such
as is often hinted at by those who refer to Chaucer and
Erasmus. In addition to the general ground of objection,
the only point raised in regard to pilgrimages by
the advocates for their suppression was that money was
spent upon them which might have been bestowed more
profitably on the poor, and that the clergy were enriched
by the offerings made at the shrines visited. Sir Thomas
More’s reply to the latter suggestion has been already
given, and elsewhere his views as to the general question
of the danger of people mistaking the nature of the
honour shown to images of the saints have been stated
at length. With regard to his approval of the principle
of pilgrimages there is no room for doubt.</p>

<p>“If the thing were so far from all frame of right
religion,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span> “and so perilous to men’s souls, I
cannot perceive why the clergy, for the gain they get
thereby, would suffer such abuses to continue. For,
first, if it were true that no pilgrimage ought to be
used, no image offered to, nor worship done nor
prayer offered to any saint, then&mdash;if all these things
were all undone (if that were the right way, as I wot
well it were wrong), then to me there is little question
but that Christian people who are in the true faith and
in the right way Godward would not thereby in any
way slack their good minds towards the ministers of
His church, but their devotion towards them would
more and more increase. So that if by this way they
now get a penny they would not then fail to receive a
groat; and so should no lucre be the cause to favour
this way if it be wrong, whilst they could not fail to
win more by the right.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>
<p>“Moreover, look through Christendom and you will
find the fruit of those offerings a right small part of the
living of the clergy, and such as, though some few
places would be glad to retain, yet the whole body
might easily forbear without any notable loss. Let us
consider our own country, and we shall find that these
pilgrimages are for the most part in the hands of such
religious persons or of such poor parishes as have no
great authority in the convocations. Besides this you
will not find, I suppose, that any Bishop in England
has the profit of even one groat from any such offering
in his diocese. Now, the continuance or breaking of
this manner and custom stands them specially in the
power of those who take no profit by it. If they
believed it to be (as you call it) superstitious and
wicked they would never suffer it to continue to the
perishing of men’s souls (something whereby they
themselves would destroy their own souls and get
no commodity either in body or goods). And beyond
this, we see that the bishops and prelates themselves
visit these holy places and pilgrimages, and make as
large offerings and (incur) as great cost in coming and
going as other people do, so that they not only take no
temporal advantage, but also bestow their own money
therein. And surely I believe this devotion so planted
by God’s own hand in the hearts of the whole Church,
that is to say, not the clergy only, but the whole congregation
of all Christian people, that if the spirituality
were of the mind to give it up, yet the temporality
would not suffer it.”</p>

<p>It would be impossible, without making extensive
quotations, to do justice to Sir Thomas More’s argument
in favour of the old Catholic practice of pilgrimages.
He points out that the whole matter turns upon
the question whether or no Almighty God does manifest
His power and presence more in one place of His world
than in another. That He does so, he thinks cannot be
questioned; why He should do so, it is not for us to
guess, but the single example of the Angel and the pool
of Bethsaida related in St. John’s Gospel is sufficient
proof of the fact&mdash;at least to Sir Thomas More’s intelligence.
Moreover, he thinks also that in many cases
the special holiness of a place of pilgrimage has been
shown by the graces and favours, and even miracles,
which have been granted by God at that particular
spot, and on the “objector” waiving this argument
aside on the plea that he does not believe in modern
miracles, More declares that what is even more than
miracles in his estimation is the “common belief in
Christ’s Church” in the practice.</p>

<p>As to believing in miracles; they, like every other
fact, depend on evidence and proof. It is unreasonable in
the highest degree to disbelieve everything which we
have not seen or which we do not understand.
Miracles, like everything else, must be believed on
the evidence of credible witnesses. What in their day,
he says, is believed in by all would have been deemed
impossible a century or two before; for example, that
the earth is round and “sails in mid-air,” and that
“men walk on it foot to foot” and ships sail on its seas
“bottom to bottom.” Again, “It is not fifty years ago,”
he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span> “since the first man, as far as men have heard,
came to London who ever parted the silver gilt from
the silver, consuming shortly the silver into dust
with a very fair water.” At first the gold and silver
smiths laughed at the suggestion as absurd and impossible.
Quite recently also More had been told that
it was possible to melt iron and make it “to run as silver
or lead doeth, and make it take a print.” More had
never, he says, seen this, but he had seen the new invention
of drawing out silver into thread-like wires. The
“objector” was incredulous, and when More went on to
tell him that if a piece of silver had been gilded, it
could be drawn out with the gilding into gilt wires, he
expressed his disbelief in the possibility of such a thing,
and was hardly more satisfied that he was not being
deceived when the process was shown to him the next
day.</p>

<p>These and such like things, argues More, show us
that our knowledge is, after all, very limited, and that
while some supposed miracles may be doubted, it is
most unreasonable to doubt or deny the possibility of
miracles generally. If nature and reason tell us there
is a God, the same two prove that miracles are not impossible,
and that God can act when He wills against
the course of nature. Whether He does in this or that
case is plainly a matter of evidence. The importance
of Sir Thomas More’s opinion on the matter of Pilgrimage
does not, of course, rest upon the nature of his
views, which were those naturally of all good Catholic
sons of Holy Church, but upon the fact that, in face of
the objections which were then made and which were
of the kind to which subsequent generations have
been accustomed, so learned and liberal a man as he
was, did not hesitate to treat them as groundless, and to
defend the practice as it was then known in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
That there may have been “abuses” he would have
no doubt fully admitted, but that the “abuses” were
either so great or so serious as to be any reasonable
ground against the “use” he would equally have indignantly
denied.</p>

<p>No less clear and definite are his opinions as to
“relics” and the honour shown them. The “adversary”
in the <i>Dyalogue</i> takes up the usual objections urged
against the reverence shown to the remains of the
saints, and in particular to the wealth which was
lavished upon their shrines. “May the taking up of a
man’s bones,” he says, “and setting his carcase in a gay
shrine, and then kissing his bare scalp, make a man a
saint? And yet are there some unshrined, for no man
knoweth where they lie. And men doubt whether some
ever had any body at all or not, but to recompense
that again some there are who have two bodies, to lend
one to some good fellow that lacketh his. For …
some one body lies whole in two places asunder, or else
the monks of the one be beguiled. For both places
plainly affirm that it lieth there, and at either place they
show the shrine, and in the shrine they show a body
which they say is <i>the</i> body, and boldly allege old
writings and miracles also for the proof of it. Now
must he confess that either the miracles at the one
place be false and done by the devil, or else that the
same saint had indeed two bodies. It is therefore likely
that a bone worshipped for a relic of some holy saint
in some place was peradventure ‘a bone (as Chaucer
says) of some holy Jew’s sheep.’” More’s “adversary”
then goes on to say that our Lord in reproving the
Pharisees for “making fresh the sepulchres of the
prophets” condemns the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span> “gay golden shrines made for
saints’ bodies, especially when we have no certainty that
they are saints at all.”<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>What all this really amounts to, replies More, is not
that your reasons would condemn honour and worship
to true relics of the saints, but that “we may be deceived
in some that we take for saints&mdash;except you
would say that if we might by any possibility mistake
some, therefore we should worship none.” Few people
would say this, and “I see,” says More, “no great
peril to us from the danger of a mistake. If there
came, for example, a great many of the king’s friends
into your country, and for his sake you make them all
great cheer; if among them there come unawares to
you some spies that were his mortal enemies, wearing
his badge and seeming to you and so reported as his
familiar friends, would he blame you for the good cheer
you made his enemies or thank you for the good cheer
you gave his friends?” He then goes on at great
length to suggest that, as in the case of the head of St.
John the Baptist in which portions only existing in each
place are each called “the head,” so, very frequently,
only a portion of the body of a saint is called “the body.”
He mentions having himself been present at the abbey
of Barking thirty years before (<i>i.e.</i> in 1498), when a
number of relics were discovered hidden in an old
image, which must have been put there four or five
hundred years since “when the abbey was burned by the
infidels.” He thinks that in this way the names of relics
are frequently either lost or changed. But he adds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
“the name is not so very requisite but that we may
mistake it without peril, so that we nevertheless have
the relics of holy men in reverence.”</p>

<p>In replying to Tyndale also, More declares that he
had never in all his life held views against relics of the
saints or the honour due to their holy images. Tyndale
had charged him with being compromised by the words
used by Erasmus in the <i>Enconium Moriæ</i>, which was
known to have been composed in More’s house, and
was commonly regarded as almost the joint work of
the two scholars. If there were anything like this in
the <i>Moriæ</i>&mdash;any words that could mean or seem to
mean anything against the true Catholic devotion to
relics and images&mdash;then More rejects them from his
heart. But they are not my words, he adds, “the book
being made by another man, though he were my darling
never so dear” (p. 422). But the real truth is that
in the <i>Moriæ</i> Erasmus never said more or meant more
than to “jest upon the abuses of such things.”</p>

<p>In this regard it is of interest to understand what
was the real opinion of Erasmus in regard to devotions
to particular saints and their images and relics. This
is all the more important, as most people regard the
account of his two pilgrimages to Walsingham and to
Canterbury as full and conclusive evidence of his sentiments.
In his tract <i>Enchiridion Militis Christiani</i>, published
at Louvain in 1518, his views are stated with absolute
clearness. “There are some,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span> “who honour
certain saints with some special ceremonies.… One
salutes St. Christopher each day, and only in presence
of his image. Why does he wish to see it? Simply
because he will then feel safe that day from any evil
death. Another honours Saint Roch&mdash;but why? Because
he thinks that he will drive away infection from
his body. Others murmur prayers to St. Barbara or
St. George, so as not to fall into the hands of any
enemy. One man fasts for St. Apollonia, not to have
toothache. Some dedicate a certain portion of their
gains to the poor so that their merchandise is not
destroyed in shipwreck,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>Our author’s point is that in these and such-like
things people pray for riches, &amp;c., and do not think
much about the right use of them; they pray for health
and go on living evil lives. In so far such prayers to
the saints are mere superstitions, and do not much differ
from the pagan superstitions; the cock to Æsculapius,
the tithe to Hercules, the bull to Neptune. “But,” he
says, “I praise those who ask from St. Roch a life protected
from disease if they would consecrate that life to
Christ. I would praise them more if they would pray
only for increased detestation of vice and love virtue.
I will tolerate infirmity, but with Paul I show the
better way.” He would think it, consequently, a more
perfect thing to pray only for grace to avoid sin and to
please God, and to leave life and death, sickness, health
and riches to Him and His will.</p>

<p>“You,” he says farther on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span> “venerate the saints,
you rejoice to possess their relics, but you despise
the best thing they have left behind them, namely,
the example of a pure life. No devotion is so pleasing
to Mary as when you imitate her humility; no religion
is so acceptable to the saints and so proper in
itself as striving to copy their virtue. Do you wish
to merit the patronage of Peter and Paul? Imitate the
faith of the one and the charity of the other and you will
do more than if you had made ten journeys to Rome.
Do you wish to do something to show high honour to
St. Francis? You are proud, you are a lover of riches,
you are quarrelsome; give these to the saint, rule your
soul and be more humble by the example of Francis;
despise filthy lucre, and covet rather the good of the
soul. Leave contentions aside and overcome evil by
good. The saint will receive more honour in this way
than if you were to burn a hundred candles to him.
You think it a great thing if clothed in the habit of St.
Francis you are borne to the grave. This dress will
not profit you when you are dead if, when alive, your
morals were unlike his.”</p>

<p>“People,” he continues, “honour the relics of St.
Paul, and do not trouble to listen to his voice still
speaking. They make much of a large portion of one
of his bones looked at through a glass, and think little
of honouring him really by understanding what he
teaches and trying to follow that.” It is the same so
often with the honour shown to the crucifix. “You
honour,” he says, “the representation of Christ’s face
fashioned of stone or of wood or painted in colours,
the image of His mind ought to be more religiously
honoured, which, by the work of the Holy Spirit, is
set forth in the gospels. No Apelles ever sketched the
form and figure of a human body in such a perfect
way as to compare with the mental image formed in
prayer.”</p>

<p>Erasmus then passes on to speak at length of what
should lie at the foundation of all true devotion to the
saints. The spirit which actuates is that which matters.
To put up candles to images of the saints and not
to observe God’s laws; to fast and to abstain and not to
set a guard on the tongue, to give way to detraction
and evil speaking of all kinds; to wear the religious
habit and to live the life of a worldling under it; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
build churches and not to build up the soul; to keep
Sunday observances externally but not to mind what
the spirit gives way to&mdash;these are the things that really
matter. “By your lips you bless and in your heart
you curse. Your body is shut up in a narrow cell,
and in thought you wander over the whole world.
You listen to God’s word with the ears of your body;
it would be more to the purpose if you listened inwardly.
What doth it profit not to do the evil which
you desire to accomplish? What doth it profit to do
good outwardly and to do the opposite inwardly? Is
it much to go to Jerusalem in the body when in the
spirit it is to thee but Sodom and Egypt and Babylon?”<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>In his tract <i>De amabili Ecclesiæ concordia</i>, printed in
1533, Erasmus lays down the same principle. It is, he
writes, a pious and good thing to believe that the saints
who have worked miracles in the time of their lives on
earth, can help us now that they are in heaven. As
long as there is no danger of real superstition, it is
absurd to try to prevent people invoking the saints.
Though superstition in the cultus of the saints is, of
course, to be prevented, “the pious and simple affection
is sometimes to be allowed even if it be mixed with
some error.” As for the representations of the saints
in churches, those who disapprove of them should not
for that reason “blame those who, without superstition,
venerate these images for the love of those they represent,
just as a newly-married woman kisses a ring or
present left or sent by her absent spouse out of affection
for him.” Such affection cannot be displeasing to
God, since it comes not from superstition, but from an
abundance of affectionate feeling, and exactly the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
view should be taken of the true devotion shown to
the relics of the saints, provided that it be ever borne
in mind that the highest honour that can be paid to
them consists in imitation of their lives.</p>

<p>Considering the importance of “indulgences” or
“pardons,” as they were frequently called, in the Reformation
controversies, it is curious that very little is
made of them in the literature of the period preceding
the religious changes. If we except the works of professed
followers of Luther, there is hardly any trace of
serious objection being raised to the fundamental idea
of “indulgences” in their true sense. Here and there
may be found indications of some objection to certain
abuses which had been allowed to creep into the system,
but these proceeded from loyal sons of the Church
rather than from those ill affected to the existing
ecclesiastical authority, or those who desired to see
the abolition of all such grants of spiritual favours.
The lawyer Saint-German, for instance, may be taken
as an example of the acute layman, who, although
professing to be a Catholic and an obedient son of
the Church, was credited by his contemporaries with
holding advanced if not somewhat heterodox views on
certain matters of current controversy. What he has
to say about “pardons” and “indulgences” is neither
very startling nor indeed very different from what all
serious-minded churchmen of that day held. He considered
that the people generally were shocked at
finding “the Pope and other spiritual rulers” granting
“pardons” for the payment of money. This, he considered,
had been brought prominently into notice at
the time he was writing, by the indulgences granted
to those who should contribute to the building of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
Peter’s when “it has appeared after, evidently that it
has not been disposed to that use. And that has caused
many to think that the said pardons were granted rather
of covetousness than of charity, or for the health of the
souls of the people. And thereupon some have fallen
in a manner into despising ‘pardons’ as though pardons
granted upon such covetousness would not
avail … and verily it were a great pity that any
misliking of pardons should grow in the hearts of the
people for any misdemeanour in the grantor or otherwise,
for they are right necessary. And I suppose that
if certain pardons were granted freely without money,
for the saying of certain appointed prayers, then all
misliking of pardons would shortly cease and vanish
away.”<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>Christopher Saint-German speaks much in the
same way as to the evil of connecting payment of
money with the granting of indulgences, in the work
in connection with which his name is chiefly known,
<i>A Dyaloge in English between a Student and a Doctor of
Divinity</i>. “If it were so ordered by the Pope,” he
writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span> “that there might be certain general pardons
of full remission in diverse parts of the realm, which
the people might have for saying certain orisons and
prayers without paying any money for it, it is not
unlikely that in a short time there would be very few
that would find any fault with ‘pardons.’ For verily
it is a great comfort to all Christian people to remember
that our Lord loved His people so much that to their
relief and comfort leave behind Him so great a treasure
as is the power to grant pardons, which, as I suppose,
next unto the treasure of His precious body in the
Sacrament of the altar, may be accounted among the
greatest, and therefore he would labour greatly to his
own hurt and to the great heaviness of all others also
who would endeavour to prove that there was no such
power left by God.”<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>In the literature of the period, it must be remembered,
there is nothing to show that the true nature of
a “pardon” or indulgence was not fully and commonly
understood. There is no evidence that it was in any
way interpreted as a remission of sin, still less that any
one was foolish enough to regard it as permission to
commit this or that offence against God. Tyndale,
indeed, had suggested that by purchasing an indulgence
“thou mayest quench almost the terrible fire of hell for
three halfpence.” But Sir Thomas More meets the
point directly. “Nay, surely,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span> “that fire is
not so lightly quenched that folk upon the boldness of
pardons should stand out of the fear of purgatory. For
though the sacrament of penance is able to put away
the eternal (nature) of the pain, yet the party for all
that has cause to fear both purgatory and hell too, lest
some default on his own part prevented God working
such grace in him in the Sacrament as should serve for
this. So, though the pardon be able to discharge a
man of purgatory, yet there may be such default in the
party to whom the pardon is granted that although
instead of three halfpence he gives three hundred
pounds, still he may receive no pardon at all, and
therefore he cannot be out of fear of purgatory, but
ever has cause to fear it. For no man without a
revelation can be sure whether he be partaker of the
pardon or not, though he may have and ought to have
both in that and every good thing good hope.”<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Gardiner in 1546, in writing against George
Joye, incidentally makes use of some strong expressions
about the granting of pardons for the payment of money,
and blames the friars as being instrumental in spreading
them. He has been asserting that by every means in
his power the devil, now in one way and now in
another, attempts to prevent men from practising the
good works necessary for salvation. “For that purpose,”
he says, “he procured out pardons from Rome,
wherein heaven was sold for a little money, and to
retail that merchandise the devil used friars for his
ministers. Now they be all gone with all their trumpery;
but the devil is not yet gone, for now the cry is
that ‘heaven needs no works at all, but only belief,
only, only, and nothing else.’”<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>This, after all, was very little more than the abuse
which previously was pointed out by the cardinal
who, conjointly with Cardinal Caraffa, afterwards Pope
Paul IV., had been directed to draw up suggestions for
improvement of ecclesiastical discipline. The document
drawn up by Caraffa himself was submitted to the
Pope by his command, and amongst the points which
were declared to need correction were the granting of
indulgences for money payments and permission given
to travelling collectors, such as the Questors of the
Holy Spirit, &amp;c., to bestow “pardons” in return for
subscriptions. This, in the judgment of the four
cardinals, is likely to lead to misunderstandings as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
to the real nature of the indulgences granted, to deceive
rustic minds, and to give rise to all manner of
superstitions.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Cardinal Sadolet, one of the four cardinals who
formed the Papal Commission just referred to, in an
appeal to the German princes makes the same adverse
criticism about the money payments received for the
granting of indulgences. “The whole of Germany,” he
says, “has been convulsed by the indulgences granted
by Pope Leo. X. to those who would contribute to the
building of St. Peter’s. These indulgences,” he says,
“and consequently the agents in distributing them, I
do not now defend. And I remember that, as far as
my position and honour would then allow, I spoke
against them when those decrees were published, and
when my opinion had no effect I was greatly grieved.”
He did not, he continued, doubt the power of the Pope
in granting the indulgences, but held that “in giving
them, the manner now insisted on with every care by
the supreme Pontiff, Paul III., ought to be maintained,
namely, that they should be granted freely, and that
there should be no mention of money in regard to
them. The loving-kindness and mercy of God should
not be sold for money, and if anything be asked for
at the time, it should be requested as a work of
piety.”<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>The above will show that earnest-minded men were
fully alive to the abuses which might be connected with
the granting of indulgences, and no condemnation could
have been stronger than that formulated by the Council
of Trent. At the same time, it is clear that the abuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
of the system were, so far as England at least is concerned,
neither widespread nor obvious. The silence
of Sir Thomas More on the matter, and the very
mild representations of his adversary, Christopher Saint-German,
show that this is the case. Saint-German’s objection
was not against the system, but against the same
kind of abuses against which subsequently the Fathers
of Trent legislated. The reformers attacked not the
abuses only but the whole system, and their language
has quite unjustly been frequently interpreted by subsequent
writers as evidence of the existence everywhere
of widespread abuses. In this regard it is well to bear
in mind that the translation of the works of the German
reformers into English cannot be taken as contemporary
evidence for England itself.</p>

<p>The cry of the advanced party which would sweep
away every vestige of the old religious observances was
certainly not popular. One example of a testimony to
the general feeling in London is given in a little work
printed by one of the reforming party in 1542, when it
was found that Henry VIII. did not advance along the
path of reformation marked out by the foreign followers
of Luther as quickly as his rejection of papal
supremacy and the overthrow of the religious houses
had caused some people to hope. The tract in question
is called <i>The lamentation of a Christian against the Citie of
London, made by Roderigo Mors</i>,<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> and some quotations
from it will show what view an ardent reformer took of
the spirit of Londoners towards the new doctrines.
“The greater part of these inordinate rich, stiff-necked
citizens,” he writes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span> “will not have in their houses that
lively word of our souls<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> nor suffer their servants to
have it, neither yet (will they) gladly read it or hear it
read, but abhors and disdains all those who would
live according to the Gospel, and instead thereof they
set up and maintain idolatry and other innumerable
wickedness of man’s invention daily committed in the
city of London.</p>

<p>“The greatest part of the seniors and aldermen, with
the multitude of the inordinate rich … with the
greatest multitude of thee, O city of London, take the
part and be fully bent with the false prophets, the
bishops and other strong, stout, and sturdy priests of
Baal, to persecute unto death all and every godly person
who either preaches the word or setteth it forth in writing
… O Lord! how blind are these citizens who
take so good care to provide for the dead which is not
commanded of them nor availeth the dead.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>… When
they feel themselves worthily plagued, which comes of
Thee only, then they will run a-gadding after their false
prophets through the streets once or twice a week, crying
and calling to creatures of the Creator, or with <i>ora
pro nobis</i>, and that in a tongue which the greatest part
of them understand not, unto Peter, Paul, James and
John, Mary and Martha: and I think within a few years
they will (without Thy great mercy) call upon Thomas
Wolsey, late Cardinal, and upon the unholy (or as they
would say holy) maid of Kent. Why not, as well as
upon Thomas Becket? What he was, I need not write.
It is well known.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>
<p>“And think ye not that if the Blessed Virgin Mary
were now upon earth and saw her Son and only Redeemer
robbed of His glory, which glory, you blind citizens give
to her, would she not rend her clothes like as did the
Apostles, for offering oblations with their forefathers’
kings’ heads unto the Queen of Heaven? How many
queens of Heaven have ye in the Litany? O! dear
brethren, be no longer deceived with these false prophets
your bishops and their members.”<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>“The great substance which you bestow upon chantries,
obits, and such like dregs of … Rome, which most
commonly ye give for three causes, as ye say, first,
that you will have the service of God maintained in the
church to God’s honour, and yet by the same service is
God dishonoured, for the Supper of the Lord is perverted
and not used after Christ’s institution … and
the holy memory turned into a vain superstitious ceremonial
Mass, as they call it, which Mass is an abominable
idol, and of all idols the greatest; and never shall
idolatry be quenched where that idol is used after antichrist’s
institution … which no doubt shall be reformed
when the time is come that God hath appointed, even as
it is already in divers cities of Germany, as Zurich, Basle,
and Strasburg and such other.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>
<p>“The second cause is for redeeming your souls and
your friends, which is also abominable.… The idolator
nowadays, if he set a candle before an image and idol,
he says he does not worship the image, but God it represents.
For say they, who is so foolish as to worship
an image? The third cause of your good intent is that
the profit of your goods may come to the priests; as
though they were the peculiar people of God and only
beloved; as indeed to those who preach the Gospel the
people are bound to give sufficient living … but not
that their prayers can help the dead no more than a
man’s breath blowing a sail can cause a great ship to
sail. So is this also become an abomination, for those
be not Christ’s ministers, but the ministers of a rabble
of dirty traditions and popish ceremonies, and you find
a sort of lusty lubbers who are well able to labour for
their living and strong to get it with the sweat of their
face.”<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>“… O ye citizens, if ye would turn but even the
profits of your chantries and obits to the finding of the
poor, what a politic and goodly provision! whereas now
London being one of the flowers of the world as touching
worldly riches hath so many, yea innumerable poor
people, forced to go from door to door and to sit openly
in the streets begging, and many not able to do otherwise
but lie in their houses in most grievous pains and
die for lack of the aid of the rich, to the great shame of
thee, oh London!”<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>After exclaiming against the amount of money spent
by the authorities of the city of London on civic entertainments,
and railing against the support given to “the
Mass of Scala cœli, of the Five wounds, and other such
like trumpery,” our author continues:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span> “Have you not
slain the servants of the Lord, only for speaking against
the authority of the false bishop of Rome, that monstrous
beast, whom now you yourselves do, or should, abhor?
I mean all his laws being contrary to Christ and not His
body, and yet you see that a few years past you burnt
for heretics abominable those who preached or wrote
against his usurped power, and now it is treason to
uphold or maintain any part of his usurped power,
and he shall die as a traitor who does so, and well
worthy.”<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>After declaiming against the Mass and confession,
and declaring that the bishops and cathedral churches
should be despoiled of their wealth as their “companions
and brethren in antichrist, the abbots” had
been, the author of the tract goes on: “God gave the
king a heart to take the wicked mammon from you, as
he may rightfully do with the consent of the Commons by
Act of Parliament, so that it may be disposed of according
to God’s glory and the commonwealth, and to take
himself as portion, as (say) eight or ten of every hundred,
for an acknowledgment of obedience and for the maintenance
of his estate. The rest politically to be put
into a commonwealth, first distributed among all the
towns in England in sums according to the quantity and
number of the occupiers and where most need is, and
all the towns to be bound to the king so that he may
have the money at his extreme need to serve him, he
rendering it again. And also a politic way (should
be) taken for provision of the poor in every town, with
some part to the marriage of young persons that lack
friends.”<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>The bishops the writer considers to be the greatest
obstacles to the reformation of religion in England
on the model of what had already taken place in
Germany. “You wicked mammon,” he continues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
“your inordinate riches was not of your heavenly
Father’s planting; therefore it must be plucked up
by the roots with the riches of your other brethren
of the Romish church or church malignant, which of
late were rightfully plucked up. I would to God that
the distribution of the same lands and goods had been
as godly distributed as the act of the rooting up was;
which distribution of the same I dare say all Christian
hearts lament. For the fat swine only were greased,
but the poor sheep to whom that thing belonged had
least or nothing at all. The fault will be laid to those
of the Parliament House, especially to those who bear
the greatest swing. Well, I touch this matter here, to
exhort all that love God’s word unfeignedly to be diligent
in prayer only to God to endue the Lords, Knights,
and Burgesses of the next Parliament with His spirit,
that the lands and goods of these bishops may be put
to a better use, as to God’s glory, the wealth of the
commonalty and provision for the poor.”<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>The above lengthy extracts will show what the advanced
spirits among the English followers of Luther
hoped for from the religious revolution which had
already, when the tract was written, been begun. It
will also serve to show that even in London, which
may be supposed to have been in the forefront of the
movement, the religious changes were by no means
popular; but the civic authorities and people clung to
the old faith and traditions, which the author well and
tersely describes as “the Romish religion.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The readers of the foregoing pages will see that no
attempt has been made to draw a definite conclusion
from the facts set down, or expound the causes of the
ultimate triumph of the Reformation principles in England.
It has already been pointed out that the time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
a satisfactory synthesis is not yet come; but it may not
be unnecessary to deprecate impatience to reach an
ultimate judgment.</p>

<p>The necessary assumption which underlies the inherited
Protestant history of the Reformation in the
sixteenth century is the general corruption of manners
and morals no less than of doctrine, and the ignorance
of religious truths no less than the neglect of religious
precepts on the part of both clergy and people. On
such a basis nothing can be easier and simpler than
to account for the issue of the English religious changes.
The revival of historical studies and the alienation of
the minds of many historians from traditional Christianity,
whether in its Catholic or Protestant form, has,
however, thrown doubt on this great fundamental assumption&mdash;a
doubt that will be strengthened the more
the actual conditions of the case are impartially and
thoroughly investigated. Many of the genuine sources
of history have only within this generation become
really accessible; what was previously known has been
more carefully examined and sifted, whilst men have
begun to see that if the truth is to be ascertained
inquiries must be pursued in detail within local limits,
and that it does not suffice to speak in general terms
of “the corrupt state of the Church.”</p>

<p>If we are to know the real factors of the problem
to be solved, separate investigations have to be pursued
which lead to very varying conclusions as to the state
of the Church, the ecclesiastical life and the religious
practices of the people in different countries. It is
already evident that the corruptions or the virtues
prevailing in one quarter must not straightway be
credited to the account of another; that the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
why one country has become Protestant, or another
remained Catholic, has to be sought for in each case,
and that it may be safely asserted that the maintenance
of Catholicity or the adoption of Protestantism in
different regions, had comparatively little to do with
prevalence or absence of abuses, or as little depended on
the question whether these were more or less grievous.</p>

<p>Unquestionably those who desire to have a ready
explanation of great historical movements or revolutions,
find themselves increasingly baulked in the
particular case of the Reformation by the new turn
which modern historical research has given to the
consideration of the question. Recent attempts to
piece up the new results with the old views afford
a warning against precipitation, and have but shown
that the explanation of the successful issue of the Reformation
in England is a problem less simple or obvious
than many popular writers have hitherto assumed. The
factors are clearly seen now to be many&mdash;sometimes
accidental, sometimes strongly personal&mdash;whilst aspirations
after worldly commodities, though destined not to
be realised for the many, were often and in the most
influential quarters a stronger determinant to acquiescence
or active co-operation in the movement than thirst
after pure doctrine, love of the open Bible, or desire for
a vernacular liturgy. The first condition for the understanding
of the problem at all is the most careful
and detailed examination possible of the state of
popular religion during the whole of the century
which witnessed the change, quite apart from the
particular political methods employed to effect the
transition from the public teaching of the old faith,
as it was professed in the closing years of the reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
of Henry VIII., and the new as it was officially practised
a dozen years after Elizabeth had held the reins
of power.</p>

<p>The interest of the questions discussed in the
present volume is by no means exclusively, perhaps
to some persons is even by no means predominantly,
a religious one. It has been insisted upon in the
preceding pages that religion on the eve of the Reformation
was intimately bound up with the whole social
life of the people, animating it and penetrating it at
every point. No one who is acquainted with the
history of later centuries in England can doubt for a
moment that the religion then professed presented in
this respect a contrast to the older faith; or as some
writers may put it, religion became restricted to what
belongs to the technically “religious” sphere. But this
was not confined to England, or even to Protestant
countries. Everywhere, it may be said, in the centuries
subsequent to the religious revolution of the sixteenth
century, religion became less directly social in its
action; and if the action and interference of what is
now called the State in every department of social
life is continually extending, this may not inaptly be
said to be due to the fact that it has largely taken up
the direct social work and direction from which the
Church found herself perhaps compelled to recede, in
order to concentrate her efforts more intensely on
the promotion of more purely and strictly religious
influences. It is impossible to study the available
sources of information about the period immediately
preceding the change without recognising that, so far
from the Church being a merely effete or corrupt agency
in the commonwealth, it was an active power for popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
good in a very wide sense. At any rate, whatever view
we may take of the results of the Reformation, to
understand rightly the conditions of religious thought
and life on the eve of the religious revolution, is a
condition of being able really to read aright our own
time and to gauge the extent to which present tendencies
find their root or their justification in the past.</p>

letters is now so common that any instance of it may seem superfluous.
Green, for example, in his <i>History of the English People</i>, vol. ii. constantly
speaks of it. Thus (p. 81), “Erasmus embodied for the Teutonic peoples the
quickening influence of the New Learning during the long scholar-life which
began at Paris and ended amidst sorrow at Basle.” Again (p. 84), “the
group of scholars who represented the New Learning in England.” Again
(p. 86), “On the universities the influence of the New Learning was like a
passing from death to life.” Again (p. 125), “As yet the New Learning,
though scared by Luther’s intemperate language, had steadily backed him in
his struggle.”</p>

may be judged by the following passages:&mdash;“How say you (O ye popish
bishops and priests which maintain Austen’s dampnable ceremonies)&mdash;For
truly so long as ye say masse and lift the bread and wine above your heads,
giving the people to understand your mass to be available for the quick and
the dead, ye deny the Lord that bought you; therefore let the mass go again
to Rome, with all Austen’s trinkets, and cleave to the Lord’s Supper”.…
Again:&mdash;“Gentle reader: It is not unknown what an occasion of sclander
divers have taken in that the king’s majesty hath with his honourable council
gone about to alter and take away the abuse of the communion used in the
mass.… The ignorant and unlearned esteem the same abuse, called the mass,
to be the principal point of Christianity, to whom the altering thereof appears
very strange.… Our popish priests still do abuse the Lord’s Supper or Communion,
calling it still a new name of <i>Missa</i> or Mass.” The author strongly
objects to those like Bishop Gardiner and Dr. Smythe who have written in
defence of the old doctrine of the English Church on the Blessed Sacrament:
“Yea, even the mass, which is a derogation of Christ’s blood. For Christ
left the sacrament of his body and blood in bread and wine to be eaten and
drunk in remembrance of his death, and not to be looked upon as the Israelites
did the brazen serpent.… Paul saith not, as often as the priest lifts the
bread and wine above his shaven crown, for the papists to gaze at.” All this,
as “the New Learning” brought over to England by St. Augustine of
Canterbury, the author would send back to Rome from whence it came.</p>

Canterbury. In 1468-69, Prior Goldstone wrote to the Earl, who
had been abroad “on pilgrimage” for four years, to try and obtain for Canterbury
the usual jubilee privileges of 1470. In his Obit in the Canterbury
<i>Necrology</i> (MS. Arund. 68 f. 45d) he is described as “vir undecumque doctissimus,

named Richard Tyll. In 1475, Thomas Goldstone, the warden of Canterbury
Hall, writes to Prior Selling about new clothes and a tunic and other expenses
“scolaris tui Ricardi Tyll.” In the same volume, p. 315, is a letter of
fraternity given to “Agnes, widow of William Tyll,” and on February 7, 1491,
she received permission to be buried where her husband, William Tyll, had
been interred, “juxta tumbam sancti Thomæ martyris.”</p>

relates to Selling’s previous stay in Rome as a student. On October 3, 1469,
the date of Selling’s second departure for Rome, the Prior and convent of
Christchurch granted a letter to Pietro dei Milleni, a citizen of Rome, making
him a <i>confrater</i> of the monastery in return for the kindness shown to Dr.
William Selling, when in the Eternal City. This letter, doubtless, Selling
carried with him in 1469.</p>

language formerly used. The work was suggested to him by a conversation
he had in England two years before, on his return from Rome, with a gentleman
he met at dinner, who strongly objected to a literary education for his
children, on the ground that he disapproved of certain expressions made use of
by Erasmus. The tract shows on what a very intimate footing Pace was with

power to assist in the foundation of schools of sound learning at Cambridge,
and especially to encourage the study of Greek. Richard Croke, the protégé
of Archbishop Warham and Bishop Fisher, after teaching Greek in 1516 at
Leipzig, was sent by Fisher in 1519 to Cambridge to urge the utility of Greek
studies at that university. In the <i>Orationes</i> he delivered there, after speaking
of the importance of Greek for all Biblical study, he says that Oxford had
taken up the work with great avidity, since “they have there as their patrons
besides the Cardinal (Wolsey), Canterbury (Warham), and Winchester, all
the other English bishops except the one who has always been your great stay
and helper, the Bishop of Rochester, and the Bishop of Ely.” It was entirely
owing to Bishop Fisher’s generosity, and at his special request, that Croke had
gone to Cambridge rather than to Oxford, whither his connection with Warham,
More, Linacre, and Grocyn would have led him, in order to carry on the work
begun by Erasmus.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Thomas Lupset was educated by Colet, and learnt his Latin and Greek
under William Lilly, going afterwards to Oxford. There he made the acquaintance
of Ludovico Vives, and at his exhortation went to Italy. He joined
Reginald Pole in his studies at Padua, and on his return, after acting as
Thomas Winter’s tutor in Paris, he held a position first as a teacher and then in
Cardinal Wolsey’s household. In his <i>Exhortation to Young Men</i>, persuading
them to a good life, “written at More, a place of my Lord Cardinal’s,” in 1529,
he gives a charming account of his relation with a former pupil. “It happeneth,”
he says, “at this time (my heartily beloved Edmund) that I am in
such a place where I have no manner of books with me to pass the time after
my manner and custom. And though I had here with me plenty of books, yet
the place suffereth me not to spend in them any study. For you shall understand
that I lie waiting on my Lord Cardinal, whose hours I must observe,
to be always at hand lest I be called when I am not bye, which would be
straight taken for a fault of great negligence. I am well satiated with the beholding
of these gay hangings that garnish here every wall.” As a relief he
turns to address his young friend Edmund. Probably Edmund doesn’t understand
his affection, because he had always acted on the principle he has “been
taught, that the master never hurteth his scholar more than when he uttereth
and sheweth by cherishing and cokering the love he beareth to his scholars.”
Edmund is now “of age, and also by the common board of houseling admitted
into the number of men, and to be no more in the company of children,” and
so now he can make known his affection. “This mind had I to my friend
Andrew Smith, whose son Christopher, your fellow, I ever took for my son.…
If you will call to your mind all the frays between you and me, or me
and Smith, you will find that they were all out of my care for ‘your manners.’
When I saw certain fantasies in you or him that jarred from true opinions, the
which true opinions, above all learning, I would have masters ever teach their
scholars. Wherefore, my good withipol, take heed of my lesson.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> John Clement, a protégé of Sir Thomas More, was afterwards a doctor
of renown not only in medicine but in languages. He had been a member
of More’s household, which Erasmus speaks of as “schola et gymnasium
Christianæ religionis.” He is named at the beginning of the <i>Eutopia</i>, and
Sir Thomas, in writing to Erasmus, says that Linacre declared that he had had
no pupil at Oxford equal to him. John Clement translated several ancient Greek
authors into Latin, amongst others many letters of St. Gregory Nazianzen and
the Homilies of Nicephorus Callistus on the Saints of the Greek Calendar.
Stapleton, in his <i>Tres Thomæ</i> (p. 250), says he had himself seen and examined
with the originals these two voluminous translations at the request of John
Clement himself. He had married Margaret, the ward of Sir Thomas More,
and in the most difficult places of his translation he was helped by his wife,
who, with the daughters of Sir Thomas, had been his disciple and knew
Greek well. Mary Roper, More’s granddaughter, and the daughter of
Margaret Roper, translated Eusebius’s <i>History</i> from Greek into Latin, but it
was never published, because Bishop Christopherson had been at work on a
similar translation. On the change of religion in Elizabeth’s reign, John
Clement and his wife, with the Ropers, took refuge in the Low Countries.
Paulus Jovius, in his <i>Descriptio Britanniæ</i>, p. 13, speaks of all three daughters
of Sir Thomas More being celebrated for their knowledge of Latin.</p>

died in 1492, had studied at Gloucester Hall, Oxford, as a monk of Westminster.
During the old age of Abbot Fleet, of Westminster, he governed
the monastery, and became its abbot in 1465. He was noted for his love of
studies, and especially for his knowledge of Greek. This, says the writer of his
brief life in the <i>National Biographical Dictionary</i>, was “a rare accomplishment
for <i>monks</i> in those days.” He might have added, and for any one
else!</p>

John Claymond, the learned Greek scholar, to his first benefice of
Westmonkton, in the county of Somerset. In 1516 Claymond became first
President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, often after signing himself,
<i>Eucharistiæ servus</i>. Dr. Claymond procured for his college several Greek
manuscripts which had belonged to Grocyn and Linacre, which are still
possessed by it. At the end of MS. XXIII., which is a volume containing
ninety homilies of St. John Chrysostom in Greek, is an inscription stating that

lecture on rhetoric at Oxford. He lived at Corpus Christi College, then ruled
by Dr. John Claymond, whom in his tract <i>De conscribendis Epistolis</i> he calls
his “father.” The fame of this Spanish master of eloquence drew crowds to his
lectures at the university, and amongst the audience Henry and Queen Katherine
might sometimes be seen. For a time he acted also as tutor to the
Princess Mary, and dedicated several works to the queen, to whose generosity
he says he owed much. He took her side in the “divorce” question, and was
thrown into prison for some weeks for expressing his views on the matter.
Fisher, More, and Tunstall were his constant friends in England, and of
Margaret Roper he writes, “from the time I first made her acquaintance I
have loved her as a sister.” Among his pupils at Louvain, besides the above-named
Canterbury monk, John Digon, he mentions with great affection
Nicholas Wotton, whom the antiquary Twyne speaks of as returning to England
with Digon and Jerome Ruffaldus, who calls Vives his “Jonathan,” and
who subsequently became abbot of St. Vaast, Arras.</p>

approval of three points in which the king proposed to change these laws.

and trespass, and then got back again, he should forfeit his privilege of
Sanctuary. <i>Secondly</i>, that though the person of a debtor might be protected
in Sanctuary, yet his goods out of the precincts were not so protected from his

every kingdom of Europe that owned the Pope’s jurisdiction, two authorities,
the one temporal and the other spiritual, and the head of the spiritual jurisdiction
was at Rome. The bishops had the rule over their clergy, even in
criminal matters, and over the laity as well in matters of faith. Even a
bishop’s decision, it is true, might be disputed, and there was an appeal to the
Pope; nay, the Pope’s decision might be disputed, and there was an appeal to a
general council. Thus there was, in every kingdom, an <i>imperium in imperio</i>,
but nobody objected to such a state of matters, not even kings, seeing that
they could, as a rule, get anything they wanted out of the Popes&mdash;even some
things, occasionally, that the Popes ought not to have conceded.”</p>

with the See of Peter. Our Lord called Cephas, Peter, or rock, to signify that
upon him as a rock He would build His church. Unto Peter He committed His
flock, and “the true Christian people which we have at this day was derived

the Pope’s power to “resort unto <i>The glasse of truth</i> or to the book named
the <i>Determinations of the universities</i>.” The book named here <i>A glasse of
truth</i> is written in favour of the divorce. “Some lawyers,” the author says,
“attribute too much to the Pope&mdash;at length there shall be no law, but only
his will.” The work was published by Berthelet anonymously, but Richard
Croke, in a letter written at this period (Ellis, <i>Historical Letters</i>, 3rd series,
ii. 195), says that the book was written by King Henry himself. It was
generally said that Henry had written a defence of his divorce; but Strype
did not think it was more than a State paper. Croke (p. 198) says that
people at Oxford, “Mr. John Roper and others,” did not believe that the
king was really the author. He says that the tract has done more than
anything else to get people to take the king’s side.</p>

this time said about the Popes, we may take the following: Rome, says
the author, “was by Justinian restored from ruin and decay, from whence also
came the riches of the Church. At the coming of these riches, forthwith the
book of the gospel was shut up, and the Bishops of Rome, instead of evangelical
poverty, began to put forth their heads garnished with three crowns.”
This is taken from the preface of Hartman Dulechin, who claims to have
“taught the book to speak Latin.” It was originally printed and published
in German. The English version is a translation of the Latin.</p>

appointed by the Bishop of Rome to search out the abuses of the Church</i>.
Translated by Richard Morysine. Berthelet, 1538.
</p>
<p>
A later copy of the <i>Concilium de emendanda Ecclesia</i>, printed by
Sturmius with his letter in 1538, in the British Museum, formerly belonged
to Cecil. The title-page has his signature, “Gulielmus Cecilius, 1540,” and
there are marks and words underlined, and some few observations from his
pen in the margin. It is interesting to note that what struck the statesman
as a youth were just the points which could be turned against the temporal
claims of the Roman See.
</p>
<p>
The special evils needing correction which the committee of cardinals
note, and which they call <i>abuses</i>, are collected under 22 headings, some of
which are the following:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(1) Ordination of priests without cure of souls, not learned, of lower order
in life, and too young and of doubtful morals: They suggest that each diocese
should have a <i>magistrum</i> to see that candidates are properly instructed&mdash;none
to be ordained except by their own bishop.
</p>
<p>
(2) Benefices, and in particular, episcopal sees, are given to people with
interest, and not because their elevation would be good for the church.
They suggest that the best man should be chosen, and residence should be
insisted on, and consequently “non Italo conferendum est beneficium in
Hispania aut in Britannia aut ex contra.”
</p>
<p>
(3) <i>Pensions</i> reserved from Benefices. Though the Pope, “who is the
universal dispenser of the goods of the church,” may reserve a part for a
pious use, <i>e.g.</i> for the poor, &amp;c., still not to reserve sufficient for the proper
purpose of the beneficiary, and still more to give a pension out of a benefice
to one rich enough without, is wrong.
</p>
<p>
(4) Change of benefices for the sake of gain, and handing on benefices by
arrangement or always assigning episcopal sees to coadjutors, is the cause of
outcry against the clergy, and is in reality making private property out of what
is public.
</p>
<p>
(5) Permission to clergy to hold more than one benefice.
</p>
<p>
(6) Cardinals being allowed to hold sees. They ought to be counsellors
to the Pope in Rome, and when holding sees they are more or less dependent
on the will of the kings, and so cannot give independent advice and speak
their minds.
</p>
<p>
(7) Absence of bishops from their sees.
</p>
<p>
(8) Such religious houses as needed correction should be forbidden to
profess members, and when they die out, their places should be taken by
fervent religious. Confessors for convents must be approved by the ordinaries
of the place.
</p>
<p>
(9) The use of the keys ought never, under any pretext, to be granted for
money.
</p>
<p>
(10) Questors of the Holy Spirit, St. Anthony, &amp;c., who foster superstition
among the poor people, should be prohibited.
</p>
<p>
(11) Confessional privileges and use of portable altars to be very rarely
allowed.
</p>
<p>
(12) No indulgences to be granted except once a year, and in the great
cities only.
</p>

Finally they say of Rome: “Hæc Romana civitas et ecclesia mater
est et magistra aliarum ecclesiarum,” and hence it should be a model to all.
Foreigners, however, who come to St. Peter’s find that priests “sordidi,
ignari, induti paramentis et vestibus quibus nec in sordidis ædibus honeste
uti possent, missas celebrant.”

Cardinal Sadolet, on receiving a copy of Sturmius’s letter, replied in kindly
terms. He had, he declared, a high opinion of “Sturmius, Melanchthon, and
Bucer, looking on them as most learned men, kindly disposed, and cordially
friendly to him. He looked upon it as the peculiar characteristic of Luther
to try and overwhelm all his opponents with shouts and attacks.” He speaks
of the great piety of Pope Clement from personal knowledge. His wars were,
he said, rather the work of his adversaries than his own (<i>De consilio</i>, ed.
J. G. Schelhorn, 1748, p. 91).
</p>
<p>
He also, in 1539, penned the <i>De Christiana Ecclesia</i> (in <i>Specilegium
Romanum</i>, ii. p. 101 <i>seqq.</i>), sending it to Cardinal Salicati, and asking him to
pass it on to Cardinal Contarini. It was the outcome of conversations about
the troubles of the Church, and the result of the movement was the Council
of Trent, to restore, as Sadolet says, ecclesiastical discipline “quæ nunc tota
pæne nobis e manibus elapsa est.”</p>

the religious generally in his sermon against Luther. After praising the state
of virginity, he continues: “And it is not to be doubted but that there is in
Christendom at this day many thousands of religious men and women that full
truly keep their religion and their chastity unto Christ.… If Almighty God
did reserve in that little portion of Jewry so great a multitude beyond the estimation
of the prophet, what number suppose ye doth yet remain in Christendom
of religious men and women, notwithstanding this great persecution of
religious monasteries, both of men and women, done by these heretics by this
most execrable doctrine? It is not to be doubted but in all Christendom be
left many thousands who at this hour live chaste, and truly keep their virginity
unto Christ.” (<i>A Sermon had at Paulis</i>, Berthelet, f. g. ii.)</p>

number of priests without very definite work had tended to diminish the
respect paid to them by the laity. “But were I Pope,” he says, … “I
could not well devise better provisions than by the laws of the Church are
provided already, if they were as well kept as they are well made. But as for
the number, I would surely see such a way therein that we should not have
such a rabble that every mean man must have a priest in his house to wait upon
his wife. This no mean man lacketh now, to the contempt of the priesthood,
(placed) in as vile an office as his horsekeeper. That is truth indeed, quod he,
and in worse, too, for they keep hawks and dogs.” If the laws of the Church
were kept, there would not be the excessive number of priests for fit and
proper positions, so that “the whole order is rebuked by the priests’ begging
and lewd living who are either obliged to walk as rovers, and live upon
trentals or worse, or serve in a secular man’s house” (<i>English Works</i>,
p. 223).</p>

ecclesiastics for their single-minded devotion to their clerical duties. He
contrasts them with clerics of other nations in regard to worldly ambitions,
&amp;c. “Those who are nearest to Christ,” he writes, “should keep themselves
free from the baser things of this world. How ill the word ‘general’ sounds
when connected with that of ‘Cardinal,’ or ‘duke’ with that of ‘bishop,’
‘earl’ with that of ‘abbot,’ or ‘commander’ with that of ‘priest.’ In
England the ecclesiastical dignity is the highest, and the revenues of churchmen
abundant. In that country, however, no one who is a bishop or abbot has
even a semblance of temporal dominion, or possesses castles or musicians or
bands of retainers, nor does any of them coin his own money, excepting only
the Archbishop of Canterbury, as a mark of dignity and honour, which has
been conferred on him on account of the death of Saint Thomas; he is, however,
never concerned in matters of war, but is occupied only in the care of
the churches.” (<i>Consultatio de Bello Turcico.</i> <i>Opera</i>, ed. Leclerc, tom. v.

discussion between Sir Thomas More and Tyndale about the use made by
the latter of the word <i>congregatio</i> for Church in his version of the New
Testament. More writes: “Then he asketh me why I have not contended
with Erasmus, whom he calls my darling, all this long time, for translating
this word <i>ecclesia</i> into this word <i>congregatio</i>, and then he cometh forth with
his proper taunt, that I favour him of likelihood for making of his book
of <i>Moriæ</i> in my house.… Now for his translation of <i>ecclesia</i> by <i>congregatio</i>
his deed is nothing like Tyndale’s. For the Latin tongue had no Latin
word used before for the Church but the Greek word <i>ecclesia</i>, therefore
Erasmus in his new translation gave it a Latin word.… Erasmus also
meant no heresy therein, as appears by his writings against the heretics.”

<i>Apologia</i>, which he addressed to the University of Louvain. He states that
Erasmus had come to his house at that place, and had asked him to aid in
the corrected version of his New Testament which he was then projecting.
At first Lee refused, but finally, on being pressed by Erasmus, he consented,
and began the work of revision, but Erasmus quickly became angry at so
many suggested changes. Reports about the annotations and corrections
proposed by Lee began to be spread abroad, and Erasmus hearing of them,
suspected some secret design, and came from Basle to try and get a copy
of the proposed criticism. Lee wished that it should be considered rather
a matter of <i>theology</i> than of <i>letters</i>. Bishop Fisher wrote, on hearing
rumours of the quarrel, urging Lee to try and make his peace with Erasmus,
and in deference to this, Lee informed Erasmus that he would leave the
matter entirely in the hands of the bishop, and had forwarded to him the
book of his proposed criticisms. Erasmus, however, did not wait, but published
the <i>Dialogus Domini Jacobi Latomi</i>, which all regarded as an attack
upon Lee. The latter would have published a reply had he not received
letters from England from Fisher, Colet, Pace, and More, begging him to keep
his temper. Lee agreed to stop, and only asked Fisher to decide the matter
quickly. On returning to Louvain, Lee found that Erasmus had published
his <i>Dialogus bilingium et trilingium</i>, in which Lee was plainly indicated as
a man hostile to the study of letters in general. This Lee denied altogether,
and in brief, he does not, he says, condemn Erasmus’s notes on the New
Testament so much as the copy he had taken as the basis for his corrections
of the later text. “Politian,” says Lee, at the end of his <i>Apologia</i>, “Politian
declares that there are two great pests of literature&mdash;ignorance and envy. To
these I will add a third&mdash;‘adulation’&mdash;for I have no belief in any one who,
having made a mistake, is not willing to acknowledge it.”
</p>
<p>
Lee’s criticism of Erasmus’s translation appeared at Louvain in January
1520. It produced an immediate reply from Erasmus, published at Antwerp
in May 1520&mdash;a reply “all nose, teeth, nails, and stomach.” In this Erasmus
says that 1200 copies of the New Testament had been printed by Froben. In
the collation he had been much assisted by Bishop Tunstall, who had, in fact,
supplied the exemplar on which he had worked. Erasmus then gives what he
thinks is the correct version of the differences between Lee and himself. Lee,
he says, was only just beginning Greek, and Erasmus, who had been working
at the correction of his version of the Testament, showed him what he was
doing. The margins of the book were then full of notes, and here and
there whole pages of paper were added. Lee said that he had a few notes
that might be useful, and Erasmus expressed his pleasure at receiving help and
asked for them. Lee thereupon gave him some miscellaneous jottings, and of
these, according to Erasmus’s version of the facts, he made use of hardly anything.
Soon, however, reports were spread about that out of some three
hundred places in which Lee had corrected the first edition of the translation,
Erasmus had adopted two hundred. Bishop Fisher tried to make peace,
and to prevent two men who both meant well to the cause of religion from
quarrelling in public. His intervention was, however, too late, as already
the letter of Erasmus to Thomas Lupset had appeared and thus rendered reconciliation
impossible.</p>

favour the idea of national churches. After declaring that national dislikes
and enmities were unmeaning and unchristian, he continues: “As an Englishman
you wish evil fortune to a Frenchman. Why not rather do your wishes
come as a man to a fellow-man? Why not as a Christian to a Christian?
Why do these frivolous things have greater weight than such natural ties,
such bonds of Christ? Places separate bodies, not souls. In old days the
Rhine divided a Frenchman from a German, but the Rhine cannot divide one
Christian from another. The Pyrenees cut off Spain from France, but these
mountains do not destroy the communion of the Church. The sea divides
the English and French peoples, but it cannot cut off the society of religion.…”
The world is the fatherland of all people; all men are sprung
from a common stock. “The Church is but one family, common to all.”

Erasmus in numberless places in his works. For example, in the tract <i>Pacis
Querimonia</i>, after saying that he cannot understand how Christians, who
understand Christ’s teaching and say their <i>Pater noster</i> with intelligence, can
always be at strife, he proceeds: “The authority of the Roman Pontiff is
supreme. But when peoples and princes wage impious wars, and that for
years, where then is the authority of the Pontiffs, where then is the power
next to Christ’s power?” &amp;c. (<i>Opera.</i>, tom. iv. p. 635). So too in his
<i>Precatio pro Pace Ecclesiæ</i>, after praying that God would turn the eyes of
His mercy upon the Church, over which “Peter was made Supreme Pastor,”
he declares that there is but “one Church, out of which there is no salvation.”</p>

of the author; at least so Erasmus was told. He wrote at the time “the
Supreme Pontiff has read through <i>Moriæ</i> and laughed; all he said was, ‘I
am glad to see that friend Erasmus is in the <i>Moriæ</i>,’ and this though I have
touched no others so sharply as the Pontiffs” (Ep. p. 1667). What Sir
Thomas More thought about it may be given in his own words, written some
years later. “As touching <i>Moriæ</i>, in which Erasmus, under the name and
person of <i>Moria</i>, which word in Greek signifies ‘folly,’ merely touches and
reproves such faults and follies as he found in any kind of people pursuing
every state and condition, spiritual and temporal, leaving almost none untouched.
By this book, says Tyndale, if it were in English, every man should
then well see that I was then far otherwise minded than I now write. If this
be true, then the more cause have I to thank God for the amendment. God
be thanked I never had that mind in my life to have holy saints’ images or
their holy relics out of reverence. Nor if there were any such thing in <i>Moriæ</i>
this could not make any man see that I were myself of that mind, the book
being made by another man though he were my darling never so dear. Howbeit,
that book of <i>Moriæ</i> doth indeed but jest upon abuses of such things.…
But in these days, in which men by their own default misconstrue and take
harm from the very Scripture of God, until men better amend, if any man
would now translate <i>Moriæ</i> into English, or some work either that I have
myself written ere this, albeit there be no harm therein, folks being (as they
be) given to take harm of what is good, I would not only my darling’s books,
but my own also, help to burn them both with my own hands, rather than
folk should (though through their own fault) take any harm of them.” (<i>English
Works</i>, pp. 422-3.)</p>

on January 14, 1506. This discovery was accidentally made in a vineyard,
near Santa Maria Maggiore, and no statue ever produced so general
and so profound an emotion as the uncovering of this work of art did upon
the learned world of Rome. The whole city flocked out to see it, and the
road to the vineyard was blocked day and night by the crowds of cardinals
and people waiting to look at it. “One would have said,” writes a contemporary,
“that it was a Jubilee.” And even to-day the visitor to the
Ara Cœli may read on the tomb of Felice de Fredis, the happy owner of the
vineyard, the promise of “immortality,” <i>ob proprias virtutes et repertum
Laocohontis divinum simulachrum</i> (I. Klaczki, <i>Jules II.</i>, p. 115). It is not
at all improbable that in the above passage Erasmus was actually thinking of
the delirium caused by the finding of this statue.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_208" id="Footnote_208"></a><a href="#FNanchor_208"><span class="label">[208]</span></a> For example, the Rev. W. H. Hutton states in the <i>Guardian</i>, January
25, 1899, as the result of his mature studies upon the Reformation period,
that “the so-called divorce question had very little indeed to do with the
Reformation.” Mr. James Gairdner, who speaks with all the authority of a
full and complete knowledge of the State papers of this period, in a letter
to a subsequent number of the <i>Guardian</i>, says, “When a gentleman of
Mr. Hutton’s attainments is able seriously to tell us this, I think it is
really time to ask people to put two and two together, and say whether
the sum can be anything but four. It may be disagreeable to trace the
Reformation to such a very ignoble origin, but facts, as the Scottish poet
says, are fellows you can’t coerce … and won’t bear to be disputed.”
What “we call <i>the</i> Reformation in England … was the result of Henry
VIII.’s quarrel with the Court of Rome on the subject of his divorce,
and <i>the same</i> results could not possibly have come about in any other
way.” When “Henry VIII. found himself disappointed in the expectation,
which he had ardently cherished for a while, that he could manage, by hook
or by crook, to obtain from the See of Rome something like an ecclesiastical
licence for bigamy,” he took matters into his own hands, “and self-willed as
he was, never did self-will lead him into such a tremendous and dangerous
undertaking as in throwing off the Pope. How much this was resented
among the people, what secret communications there were between leading
noblemen with the imperial ambassador, strongly urging the emperor to
invade England, and deliver the people from a tyranny from which they were
unable to free themselves, we know in these days as we did not know before.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_210" id="Footnote_210"></a><a href="#FNanchor_210"><span class="label">[210]</span></a> The same high authority, in a letter to the <i>Guardian</i>, March 1, 1899,
says, “People will tell you, of course, that the seeds of the Reformation were
sown before Henry VIII.’s days, and particularly that it was Wycliffe who
brought the great movement on. I should be sorry to depreciate Wycliffe,
who did undoubtedly bring about a great movement in his day, though a
careful estimate of that movement is still a <i>desideratum</i>. Even in theology
the cardinal doctrine of the Reformation&mdash;justification by faith&mdash;is in Wycliffe,
I should say, conspicuous by its absence. But, whatever may be the theological
debt of England to Wycliffe at the present day, twenty Wycliffes,
all highly popular, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries would not have
brought about a Reformation like that under which we have lived during the
last centuries. That was a thing which could only have been effected by
royal power&mdash;as in England, or by a subversion of royal authority through
the medium of successful rebellion&mdash;as in Scotland.”</p>

Bishop Tunstall calls it, was printed abroad, and “very many lately brought

objectionable portion was contained in “a declaration made in the kalendar

decollation of St. John Baptist, to show the cause of why he was beheaded.”

Thomas More is generally ignored by modern writers. In a recently published
work, for example (<i>England in the Age of Wycliffe</i>, by George
Macaulay Trevelyan), it is stated that “we have positive proof that the
bishops denounced the dissemination of the English Bible among classes and
persons prone to heresy, burnt copies of it, and cruelly persecuted Lollards on
the charge of reading it” (p. 131). In proof of this statement the author
refers his readers to a later page (p. 342) of his volume. Here he culls from
Foxe (<i>Acts and Monuments</i>) the depositions of certain witnesses against people
suspected of teaching heresy. Amongst these depositions it is said by a few
of the witnesses that some of these teachers were possessed of portions of the
Scriptures in English. Mr. Trevelyan assumes, because witnesses speak to
this fact, that it was for this they were condemned, or, as he puts it, “cruelly
persecuted,” by the ecclesiastical authorities. Had he examined his authority,
Foxe, more carefully, he would have found the actual list of <i>articles</i> formulated
against these teachers of heresy. These alone are, of course, the <i>charges</i>
actually made against them; and the mere deposition of witnesses in those days
were, no more than they are in ours, the charges upon which the accused were
condemned. In the <i>articles</i> or charges we find no mention whatever of the
English Bible, and, according to the ordinary rules of interpretation of documents,
this absence of any mention of Bible-reading in the indictment, formulated
after the hearing of the evidence, and when witnesses had testified
to the fact, should be taken to show that the mere possession of the vernacular
Scriptures, &amp;c., was not accounted an offence by the Church authorities. The
real charge in these cases, as in others, was of teaching what was then held
to be false and heretical, teaching founded upon false interpretations of the
Scripture text, or upon false translations.</p>

The amateur theologians and teachers who sprung up so plentifully with
the growth of Lutheran ideas in England seem to have been a source of
trouble to the clergy. There was no difficulty in Scripture so hard which
these “barkers, gnawers, and railers,” as Roger Edgworth calls them, were
not ready to explain, and even women were ready to become teachers of
God’s Word, “and openly to dispute with men.” Speaking in Bristol,
in Mary’s reign, he advises his audience to stick to their own occupations
and leave theology and Scripture alone, “for when a tailor forsaking his
own occupation will be a merchant venturer, or a shoemaker will become
a grocer, God send him help. I have known,” he says, “many in this town
that studying divinity has killed a merchant, and some of other occupations by
their busy labours in the Scripture hath shut up the shop windows, and were
fain to take sanctuary, or else for mercery and grocery hath been fain to sell
godderds, steaves, pitchers, and such other trumpery.”</p>

advocated, take the following instance. Caxton’s translation of the <i>Vitæ
Patrum</i>, published by Wynkyn de Worde in 1495, contained an exhortation
to all his readers to study the Holy Scripture. “To read them is in part
to know the felicity eternal, for in them a man may see what he ought to do
in conversation … oft to read purgeth the soul from sin, it engendereth
dread of God, and it keeps the soul from eternal damnation.” As food
nourishes the body, “in like wise as touching the soul we be nourished by
the lecture and reading of Scripture.… Be diligent and busy to read the
Scriptures, for in reading them the natural wit and understanding are
augmented in so much that men find that which ought to be left (undone)
and take that whereof may ensue profit infinite” (p. 345).</p>

(1506), <i>Horæ</i>, &amp;c. (1506), <i>Speculum Spiritualium</i>, and Hampole, <i>De Emendatione
Vitæ</i> (1510), (cf. <i>Ames</i>, Ed. Herbert, iii. p. 16). Pepwell the London

books printed abroad, and had dealings with Bishops Stokesley and Tunstall.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_307" id="Footnote_307"></a><a href="#FNanchor_307"><span class="label">[307]</span></a> For further information upon popular religious instruction in England,
see an essay upon the teaching in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in my
<i>The old English Bible, and other Essays</i>. The Rev. J. Fisher, in his tract
on <i>The Private Devotions of the Welsh</i> (1898), speaking of the vernacular
prayer-books, says, “they continued to be published down to the end of
Henry’s reign, and, in a modified form, even at a later date. Besides these
prymers and the oral instruction in the principal formulæ of the Church, the
scriptorium of the monastery was not behind in supplying, especially the
poor, with horn-books, on which were, as a rule, written in the vulgar tongue
the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, and the Hail Mary.” In 1546 appeared a
prymer in Welsh in which, amongst other things, the seven capital or deadly
sins and their opposite virtues are given and analysed. This book, consequently,
besides being a prayer-book afforded popular instruction to the people
using it. The prymers in Welsh, we are told, were usually called “Matins’
Books,” and continued to be published long after the change of religion. A
copy published in 1618 is called the fifth edition, and copies of it are recorded
under the years 1633 and 1783. “It is rather a curious fact,” writes Mr.
Fisher, “that nearly all the Welsh manuals of devotion and instruction, of
any size, published in the second half of the sixteenth and the first half of
the seventeenth century, were the productions of Welsh Roman Catholics,
and published on the Continent. In Dr. Gruffydd Roberts’s Welsh Grammar,
published at Milan in 1567, will be found poetical versions of the Apostles’
Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, the Hail Mary, the Ten Commandments and the
Seven Sacraments. This work was followed by the <i>Athravaeth Gristnogavl</i>,
a short catechism of religious doctrine, translated or compiled by Morys
Clynog, the first Rector of the English College in Rome. It was published
at Milan in 1568, and contains the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, the Hail Mary,
the Ten Commandments, &amp;c., in Welsh, with expositions.”
</p>
<p>
The above, with the prayer-books of 1567, 1586, 1599, were all the works
of religious instruction and devotion (private and public) that appeared in
Welsh down to the end of the sixteenth century. I might add that there is
in the Earl of Macclesfield’s collection a large folio volume of <i>Miscellanea</i>
(Shirburn MS. 113, D. 30), written between 1540 and 1560, which contains
a prymer occupying several pages. There is also in the Swansea Public
Library a Welsh-Latin MS. of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, written
in different hands and in the South Walian dialect, which forms a manual of
Roman Catholic devotion, containing in Welsh devotions for Mass, the usual
meditations and prayers for various occasions, instructions, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
With the seventeenth century there is a good crop of manuals of devotion
and instruction, such as the catechisms of Dr. Rosier Smith (1609-1611) and
Father John Salisbury (1618 <i>tacito nomine</i>), both Welsh Roman Catholics
(pp. 24-26).</p>

windows placed in their present positions between the years 1480 and 1530.
Almost all of them were put in by individuals, as the inscriptions below testify.
In the case of three of the lights it appears that groups of people joined together
to beautify their parish church. Thus below one of the windows in the
north aisle is the following: “<i>Ex sumptibus juvenum hujus parochiæ Sancti
Neoti qui istam fenestram fecerunt anno domini millessimo quingentessimo
vicessimo octavo</i>.” Another window states that it was made in 1529, “<i>Ex
sumptibus sororum hujus parochiæ</i>”; and a third in 1530, “<i>Ex sumptibus
uxorum</i>.”</p>

describe the practical doctrine of the English pre-Reformation Church on this
matter: “The chiefest and most excellent rule for the right use of money,”
he says, “rests on the principle that it is one thing to have a right to the
possession of money and another to have the right to use money as one
pleases.… If the question be asked, How must one’s possessions be used?
the Church replies, without hesitation, in the words of the same holy doctor
(St. Thomas), <i>Man should not consider his outward possessions as his own, but
as common to all</i>, so as to share <i>them without difficulty when others are in need</i>.
When necessity has been supplied and one’s position fairly considered, it is a
duty to give to the indigent out of that which is over. It is a duty, not of
justice (except in extreme cases) but of Christian charity … (and) to sum up
what has been said, Whoever has received from the Divine bounty a large
share of blessings … has received them for the purpose of using them for
the perfecting of his own nature, and, at the same time, that he may employ
them, as the minister of God’s Providence, for the benefit of others.”</p>

society, is worth recording. In 1411, and subsequent years, an annual payment
of 13s. 4d. is entered on the accounts as made to one Thomas
Deverosse, a tailor, and apparently a member of the fraternity. The history
of this man’s poverty is curious. When Bishop William of Wykeham,
desiring to build Winchester College, purchased certain lands for the purpose,
amongst the rest was a field which a tailor of Winchester, this Thomas
Deverosse, subsequently claimed; and to make good his contention, brought
a suit of ejectment against the Bishop. The case was tried in the King’s
Bench, and the tailor not only lost, but was cast in costs and so ruined.
With some writers, William of Wykeham’s good name had been allowed to
suffer most unjustly for his share in the misfortunes of the unlucky tailor; for
the Bishop not only undertook to pay the costs of the suit himself, but agreed
that the college should make the unfortunate claimant a yearly allowance of
8d. to assist him in his poverty. The Tailors’ Guild secured to him a
pension of 13s. 4d.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_344" id="Footnote_344"></a><a href="#FNanchor_344"><span class="label">[344]</span></a> Here is the bill for the annual feast in the Guild of Tailors of Winchester
in 1411. The association was under the patronage of St. John the Baptist, and
they kept their feast on the Day of the beheading of the Saint, August 29.
In this year, 1411, the 29th of August fell upon a Saturday, which in mediæval
times, as all know, was a day of abstinence from flesh-meat. It is to be
noticed, consequently, that provision is made for a fish dinner: “6 bushels of
wheat at 8½d. the bushel; for grinding of the same, 3d.; for baking the same,
6d.; ready-made bread purchased, 12d.; beer, 7s. 1d.; salt fish bought of
Walter Oakfield, 6s. 8d.; mullet, bass, ray, and fresh conger bought of the
same Walter, 6s. 8d.; fresh salmon of the same, 8s.; eels, 10½d.; fresh fish
bought of John Wheller, ‘fisher,’ 2s.; ditto, of Adam Frost, 9s.; ditto,
bought of a stranger, 2s. 8d.; beans purchased, 9d.; divers spices, <i>i.e.</i> saffron,
cinnamon, sanders, 12½d.; salt, 2d.; mustard, 2½d.; vinegar, 1d.; tallow, 2d.;
wood, 18d.; coals, 3½d.; paid to Philip the cook, 2s.; to four labourers,
2s. 6d.; to three minstrels, 3s. 4d.; for rushes to strew the hall, 4d.; three
gallons and one pint of wine, 19d.; cheese, 8d.” Making in all a total of
£3, 4s. 3½d. This, no doubt, represented a large sum in those days, but it is
as well to remember that at this time the guild consisted of 170 men and
women, and the cost of the feast was not one-sixth part of the annual income.</p>

had been dissolved by Henry VIII., and the property granted to Sir George

ecclesiastics strove to impress upon the minds of the people the true
principles of devotion to shrines and relics of the saints. To take one
example beyond what is given above. In <i>The Art of Good Lyvyng and

places that are holy, and the relics of holy bodies of saints and their images,
not for themselves, but for that in seeing them we show honour to what it
represents, the dread reverence, honour and love of God, after the intention
of Holy Church, otherwise it were idolatry” (fol. 6).</p>

<p><b>Dublin Review.</b>&mdash;“The recognised authority on the subject upon which it treats.”</p>

<p><b>Tablet.</b>&mdash;“Produced in excellent style, we welcome and recommend this new edition
of an old work by such a pioneer of historical truth as Dr. Gasquet with renewed confidence,
for the next best thing to a new work from such a hand is a carefully revised and
cheaper edition of an old one.”</p>

<p><b>Church Times.</b>&mdash;“Dr. Gasquet’s work has won for itself so secure a position that
it is superfluous to point out its merits afresh, but the author in the preface to the new
edition calls attention to certain alterations necessitated by the publication by Dr. James
Gairdner of the Calendar of Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII. These documents have
now been arranged in volumes, consequently a very considerable re-arrangement of
references has been rendered necessary, in order to facilitate the consultation of the
original documents. This popular edition will be greatly appreciated by the students
of this period of England’s ecclesiastical history.”</p>

<p><b>Catholic Book Notes.</b>&mdash;“A standard authority, if not a classic … we congratulate
author and publisher on its production in one handsome volume. We anticipate a large
sale … and would especially recommend it as a suitable volume for prizes in the higher
classes of our schools.”</p>

<p><b>Saturday Review.</b>&mdash;“On the whole, it would be difficult within the limits that the author has
set for himself to write a more interesting book. We recommend, more especially to the general
reader, the three chapters on the life of a monk in the world and in his monastery, and that describing
the life of women under the rule.”</p>

<p><b>Literature.</b>&mdash;“We are struck with the skill with which he has mastered the details of a somewhat
complicated story, and the clear way he has set it down for the benefit of his readers.”</p>

<p><b>English Historical Review.</b>&mdash;“Here, for the first time, the story of the Benedictine mission of
1603 is fully told in English; in this story the central figure is Dom Augustine Baker, the true author
of the ‘Apostolatus,’ who, being professed by the aged Buckley, the last survivor of Westminster,
claimed the inheritance of the rights and privileges of the original congregation, and the power, by
professing others, to hand on the inheritance to posterity. The story of the English Benedictine congregation
in its settlements abroad, and finally in its settlements at home, is very skilfully told, in a
pleasant, popular style.”</p>

<p><b>Literary World.</b>&mdash;“The story of the English Benedictines is one that will be read with sympathy
and even admiration by the instructed Protestant. Curiously enough the history of the Order&mdash;not
the exact word, but no better offers&mdash;has a striking affinity with the principles of Congregationalism.
The strength of the Order was that it consisted of independent homes, and was not like most fraternities,
a great whole subdivided into communities. Upon this Father Taunton again and again insists,
and his view is indisputable. Of the two volumes before us the first will be more generally interesting
to Englishmen, but it may be well to prepare our readers for its perusal by saying that the almost
patronising style of the beginning is not long continued. We feared at first that the author was going
to talk down to us in pity for our ignorance, and were accordingly prepared to resent his impertinence.
A very few pages onward and we yielded ourselves willingly to his pleasant instruction.… A good
book, which we can heartily recommend to the open-minded reader.”</p>

<p><b>Liverpool Post.</b>&mdash;“Two large and well-printed volumes contain what the writer modestly
describes as a ‘sketch’ of the Benedictine Order in England from the coming of Augustine in the sixth
century up to the present time. The work is something more than a theological history. It is in one
aspect a history of English society during fifteen hundred years, for the Benedictines were ever closely
in touch with the people among whom they laboured. Mr. Taunton is not an ecclesiastical zealot,
and he writes with admirable impartiality, as witness his outspoken condemnation of the intrigues of
Rome and the machinations of the Jesuits in England during the reigns of Elizabeth and James.
Hence his opinions on such a question as the social consequences to England of the closing of the
monasteries is deserving of greater weight.”</p>

<p><b>Glasgow Herald.</b>&mdash;“In these two portly volumes Mr. Taunton furnishes us with a very full
history of the English Benedictines, describing it as ‘a tribute of the affection and esteem which I,
an outsider, have for the English monks.’ There is doubtless room for such a work, and it must be
said that Mr. Taunton has brought to his task abundant enthusiasm and much painstaking research.
… We cordially welcome it for its accumulation of valuable historical materials, and for the author’s
industry we have nothing but praise.”</p>

<p><b>Daily Chronicle.</b>&mdash;“When it is remembered that in these two volumes (January and February)
the biographies of more than four hundred saints are to be found, and that in every case the
authorities from which they are derived are set forth; that in the Introduction the reader is furnished
with a succinct account of the literature of the subject which is the best <i>résumé</i> that we have in
English; that errors in the previous edition are not left uncorrected&mdash;it will be seen how much is to
be expected from this new issue of Mr. Baring-Gould’s wonderful work, and how much will be found
in the sixteen volumes which will be required to complete it.… No student of history&mdash;to go no
further&mdash;can dispense with such a valuable book of reference. There is nothing like it in our
language.”</p>

<p><b>Standard.</b>&mdash;“The earlier volumes of the new edition are before us, and even a cursory examination
is enough to show that the work has been thoroughly revised.… The book is of real value,
since it is written with scholarly care, imaginative vision, and a happy union of charity and courage.”</p>

<p><b>Guardian.</b>&mdash;“Whoever reads the more important lives in the sixteen volumes of which this new
edition is to consist, will be introduced to a region of which historians for the most part tell him little,
and yet one that throws constant light upon some of the obscurest points of ordinary histories. For
this, and for the pleasure and profit thence derived, he will have to thank Mr. Baring-Gould.”</p>

<p><b>Scotsman.</b>&mdash;“Mr. Baring-Gould, Anglican priest though he be, fulfils the promise of his
original edition in so far as he does not obtrude either prejudice or sectarianism into his record of
these Saints.”</p>

<p><b>British Review and National Observer.</b>&mdash;“The new edition of Mr. Baring-Gould’s
familiar work may well be called monumental, both on account of its size, and the variety and
completeness of the information to be found in it.”</p>

<p><b>Notes and Queries.</b>&mdash;“It is impossible to mention the various sources whence have been
drawn the illustrations, which will render this work, to those to whom the subject appeals, the most
acceptable, as it is certainly the handsomest, of existing editions.”</p>

<p><b>Weekly Sun.</b>&mdash;“We unhesitatingly commend it as well to the lover of mediævalism as the
student who must have at hand encyclopædic volumes of reference. No library that aims at being
comprehensive can afford to be without it. No student of ecclesiastical and cathedral antiquities
can neglect it if he wishes to make a successful study of his particular subject.”</p>

<p><b>Christian World.</b>&mdash;“The new edition is tastefully got up, and is a worthy setting of a great
literary enterprise. The ‘Lives of the Saints’ is a human story of unfading interest.”</p>

<p class="hanging">Studies in the Religious Life and Thought of the English People in
the Period preceding the Rejection of the Roman Jurisdiction by
Henry VIII. By <span class="smcap">Francis Aidan Gasquet</span>, D.D., O.S.B., Author
of “Henry VIII. and the English Monasteries,” “The Old English
Bible, and other Essays,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This is not a controversial work, but a study chiefly of the literature,
&amp;c., of the period in order to see what people were doing, saying, and
thinking about before the change of religion. As touching upon rather new
ground, and at the same time widening the field of view in the Reformation
question, it should be of great interest at the present moment.</p>

<p>“The present edition of the ‘Spectator’ has been printed from a copy of the
original collected and revised edition published in 1712-15, with the exception that
modern rules of spelling have been followed. The principal variations between the
text as corrected by the authors and the original version in the folio numbers have
at the same time been indicated in the notes; it has not been thought necessary to
point out slight differences of no importance. In the notes I have aimed at the
greatest conciseness compatible with the satisfactory explanation of the less obvious
allusions to literary or social matters. I have acknowledged my principal
obligations to more recent editors, but in some cases notes have been handed down
from one editor to another, and cannot be traced to their original author. Many of
the older notes, moreover, were obsolete, or needed correction in the light of subsequent
knowledge. I have endeavoured to preserve what is of value, without burdening
the pages with the contradictions and inaccuracies which are inevitable in a <i>variorum</i>
edition.”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="center"><i>Some Press Notices.</i></p>

<p><b>Pall Mall Gazette.</b>&mdash;“Undoubtedly the best library reprint of this famous periodical that has
been published.”</p>

<p><b>Daily News.</b>&mdash;“If handsome print, paper, and binding, together with careful annotation, have
attractions in the eyes of lovers of standard books, there ought to be a good demand for this new
edition.”</p>

<p><b>Scotsman.</b>&mdash;“An edition in which it is a pleasure to read, and one which would adorn any
library.”</p>

<p><b>Notes and Queries.</b>&mdash;“We congratulate the publisher and the editor on the termination of a
useful task, and we commend to the public this eminently desirable edition of our English masterpiece&mdash;the
most attractive and serviceable yet printed.”</p>

<p><b>Birmingham Post.</b>&mdash;“An edition of the ‘Spectator’ which, as a book for the library, has no
equal, whether we consider the stately and appropriate form, the typographical excellence, or the
erudite and finished editing. Added to these is the crowning grace of a full and complete index.
It is a luxury to read the early eighteenth century classic in such an edition as this.”</p>

<p><b>Glasgow Herald.</b>&mdash;“All that the most fastidious lover of books could desire. Its size&mdash;extra
crown octavo&mdash;is stately, without being cumbersome. The buckram cloth binding is neat, substantial,
and serviceable&mdash;exactly what is required for a library of which the contents are intended for use as
well as for show. The notes supplied by Mr. George A. Aitken, as might be expected from his
exceptional acquaintance with the period, enable the reader to understand and appreciate the numerous
allusions to literary and social matters which occur in most of the papers.”</p>

<p><b>Daily Chronicle.</b>&mdash;“When it is remembered that in these two volumes (January and February)
the biographies of more than four hundred saints are to be found, and that in every case the
authorities from which they are derived are set forth; that in the Introduction the reader is furnished
with a succinct account of the literature of the subject which is the best <i>résumé</i> that we have in
English; that errors in the previous edition are not left uncorrected&mdash;it will be seen how much is to
be expected from this new issue of Mr. Baring-Gould’s wonderful work, and how much will be found
in the sixteen volumes which will be required to complete it.… No student of history&mdash;to go no
further&mdash;can dispense with such a valuable book of reference. There is nothing like it in our
language.”</p>

<p><b>Standard.</b>&mdash;“The earlier volumes of the new edition are before us, and even a cursory examination
is enough to show that the work has been thoroughly revised.… The book is of real value,
since it is written with scholarly care, imaginative vision, and a happy union of charity and courage.”</p>

<p><b>Guardian.</b>&mdash;“Whoever reads the more important lives in the sixteen volumes of which this new
edition is to consist, will be introduced to a region of which historians for the most part tell him little,
and yet one that throws constant light upon some of the obscurest points of ordinary histories. For
this, and for the pleasure and profit thence derived, he will have to thank Mr. Baring-Gould.”</p>

<p><b>Scotsman.</b>&mdash;“Mr. Baring-Gould, Anglican priest though he be, fulfils the promise of his
original edition in so far as he does not obtrude either prejudice or sectarianism into his record of
these Saints.”</p>

<p><b>British Review and National Observer.</b>&mdash;“The new edition of Mr. Baring-Gould’s
familiar work may well be called monumental, both on account of its size, and the variety and
completeness of the information to be found in it.”</p>

<p><b>Notes and Queries.</b>&mdash;“It is impossible to mention the various sources whence have been
drawn the illustrations, which will render this work, to those to whom the subject appeals, the most
acceptable, as it is certainly the handsomest, of existing editions.”</p>

<p><b>Weekly Sun.</b>&mdash;“We unhesitatingly commend it as well to the lover of mediævalism as the
student who must have at hand encyclopædic volumes of reference. No library that aims at being
comprehensive can afford to be without it. No student of ecclesiastical and cathedral antiquities
can neglect it if he wishes to make a successful study of his particular subject.”</p>

<p><b>Christian World.</b>&mdash;“The new edition is tastefully got up, and is a worthy setting of a great
literary enterprise. The ‘Lives of the Saints’ is a human story of unfading interest.”</p>

<p class="center clearboth"><i>Some Press Notices of the Large Type Border Edition of
the Waverley Novels.</i></p>

<p><b>The Spectator.</b>&mdash;“We trust that this fine edition of our greatest and most poetical
of novelists will attain, if it has not already done so, the high popularity it deserves. To
all Scott’s lovers it is a pleasure to know that, despite the daily and weekly inrush of
ephemeral fiction, the sale of his works is said by the booksellers to rank next below
Tennyson’s in poetry, and above that of everybody else in prose.”</p>

<p><b>The Times.</b>&mdash;“It would be difficult to find in these days a more competent and
sympathetic editor of Scott than his countryman, the brilliant and versatile man of letters
who has undertaken the task; and if any proof were wanted either of his qualifications
or of his skill and discretion in displaying them, Mr. Lang has furnished it abundantly
in his charming Introduction to ‘Waverley.’ The editor’s own notes are judiciously
sparing, but conspicuously to the point, and they are very discreetly separated from those
of the author, Mr. Lang’s laudable purpose being to illustrate and explain Scott, not to
make the notes a pretext for displaying his own critical faculty and literary erudition.
The illustrations by various competent hands are beautiful in themselves and beautifully
executed, and, altogether, the ‘Border Edition’ of the Waverley Novels bids fair to
become the classical edition of the great Scottish classic.”</p>

<p><b>The Athenæum.</b>-“The handsome ‘Border Edition’ has been brought by Mr.
Nimmo to a successful conclusion. Mr. Nimmo deserves to be complimented on the
manner in which the Edition has been printed and illustrated, and Mr. Lang on the way
in which he has performed his portion of the work. His Introductions have been
tasteful and readable; he has not overdone his part; and, while he has supplied much
useful information, he has by no means overburdened the volumes with notes.”</p>

<p><b>Notes and Queries.</b>&mdash;“Mr. Nimmo’s spirited and ambitious enterprise has been
conducted to a safe termination, and the most ideal edition of the Waverley Novels in
existence is now completed.”</p>

<p><b>Saturday Review.</b>&mdash;“Of all the many collections of the Waverley Novels, Mr.
Nimmo’s ‘Border Edition’ is incomparably the most handsome and the most desirable.…
Type, paper, illustrations are altogether admirable.”</p>

<p><b>Daily Chronicle.</b>&mdash;“There is absolutely no fault to be found with it, as to paper,
type, or arrangement.”</p>

<p><b>Magazine of Art.</b>&mdash;“Size, type, paper, and printing, to say nothing of the excessively
liberal and charming introduction or of the illustrations, make this perhaps the most
desirable edition of Scott ever issued on this side of the border.”</p>

can produce, rivalling&mdash;and it is no slight praise&mdash;the admirable egg-pictures of Hewitson, some of
which might almost have been executed by hand; and the book is written in an easy, pleasant style,
redolent of the field rather than of the study.”</p>

<p><b>Zoologist.</b>&mdash;“The text contains not only a description of each egg and its varieties, but also a
very full account of the life-history of each bird.… If we may conceive the works of Yarrell and
Hewitson rolled into one, with corrections, emendations, and important additions, and with woodcuts
as well as coloured plates, such a work is Mr. Seebohm’s.”</p>

<p class="hanging">In Two Volumes, Large 8vo, Cloth, Gilt Top, price £1, 10s. Net. With Thirty-seven
Illustrations, including Three hitherto unpublished Bird Drawings and
Ten Portraits of Audubon.</p>

<p class="title">Audubon, and His Journals.</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Maria R. Audubon</span>. With Notes by <span class="smcap">Elliott Coues</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contents.</span>&mdash;Audubon: A Biography. The European Journals, 1826-29. The
Labrador Journal, 1833. The Missouri River Journal, 1843. The Episodes. With a
full Index.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;To English people the name of Audubon is a familiar and respected one,
and there is little reason to doubt that the present work, forming as it does so handsome
a monument of his life’s work, should be acceptable both to the lover of good books and
to the naturalist. The former has the attraction of Audubon’s picturesque and engaging
English style, added to reminiscences and narratives of a diverse and fascinating character,
and a highly interesting biography of Audubon from the pen of his granddaughter.
The naturalist, on the other hand, has here for the first time the complete and carefully
edited text of Audubon’s valuable journals, supplemented by appropriate and interesting
notes by so eminent a zoologist as Dr. Elliott Coues. The entire publication is virtually
new, since even the European journals are here much amplified, while the Missouri and
Labrador journals are practically unpublished, and the “Episodes” have never before
appeared collectively except in a French translation. The work is one of the widest
interest, and must at once take its place as the authoritative biography of Audubon, as
well as the first adequate presentation of his journals, which in their now complete form
give “the man instead of the death mask.”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><b>Times.</b>&mdash;“Audubon’s unpublished manuscripts are the record of a long, a varied,
and an adventurous life, passed in unremitting activity and indefatigable industry. We
must say at once that for the most part they are fascinating. They are sensational, instructive,
and frankly autobiographical, and they show a many-sided man in his various
aspects, with the absolute unreserve of innocent egoism.”</p>

<p><b>Saturday Review.</b>&mdash;“There is much that will interest readers of vastly different
tastes. Thus the European journals in the first volume have an interest that is chiefly
personal, and we get interesting scraps of conversation with Sir Walter Scott, Jeffrey,
Wilson, Lord Stanley, Cuvier, St. Hilaire, Selby, Constant, Gerard, Jardine, and Bewick,
as well as many other notables in the science, art, and literature of Edinburgh, London,
and Paris in the late twenties.”</p>

<p><b>Spectator.</b>&mdash;“The two volumes present the life of the great French-American naturalist
in a most attractive form. The journal of his voyage up the Missouri is now first given
to the world, and the freshness of his life in the woods and of his own charming personality
is not marred by any unwise editing or comment. The illustrations are excellent, worthy
of a work dealing with the life of the man who used the instruction received from the
revolutionary painter David in his youth to make the greatest advance in the illustration
of nature ever achieved by one man.”</p>

<p><b>Scotsman.</b>&mdash;“A worthy and enduring memorial has been raised to the great American
ornithologist in the two volumes prepared by his granddaughter. Miss Audubon’s work
has been admirably done; and the worth of the book is much enhanced by the zoological
and other notes which Dr. Coues has appended.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
